Quality of life embraces not just material well-being, but freedom of choice to engage in the arts, culture and all aspects of civic life. This vision applies in the context of Ireland, Europe and the wider world and challenges the existing economic order.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Congress Mission&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Congress will strive to achieve economic development, social cohesion and justice by upholding the values of solidarity, fairness and equality.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The primary instrument for the achievement of this mission will be the organisation of workers in unions. Congress will also construct and advocate for a platform of policies capable of delivering our vision of a just society. We will engage with Government, employers, civil society organisations, voluntary groups and international bodies to promote its attainment. We will support unions in their efforts to secure a fairer distribution of the wealth their members create.","acronym":"ICTU","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Audiovisual and Media, Budget, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Congress operates within all EU guidelines, and reflects EU policy and legislation in all of it's undertakings.","lastUp":"2018-01-30T11:14:24.320+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"4000000-4249999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
