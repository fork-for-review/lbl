We help our clients relate their business challenges to the world around them, identify the key factors and priority areas for action, and devise strategic approaches that&#xd;<br />improve reputation. We enable our clients to successfully navigate the increasingly complex and challenging communications environment by identifying the most appropriate approaches, tools and tactics to deliver their programme, offline and online, adopting a classic ‘channel neutral’ approach.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />While embracing the potential of new communication channels, we believe that intelligent and compelling content is the foundation for successful corporate communications. We translate business strategy into actionable communications campaigns - which often means not just working with client headquarters but also with business units to deliver. We build and manage corporate reputations, protecting them, through the identification and management of issues before they become a crisis.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our areas of expertise include:&#xd;<br />•Communications strategy development &#xd;<br />•Messaging and positioning &#xd;<br />•Advocacy &#xd;<br />•Regulatory &#xd;<br />•Institutional Relationship Building&#xd;<br />•Issues and crisis preparedness and management &#xd;<br />•Stakeholder relations&#xd;<br />•Optimising communication structures&#xd;<br />•Strategy communication&#xd;<br />•International implementation&#xd;<br />•Media relations","acronym":"Aspect","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Audiovisual and Media, Climate Action, Communication, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Development, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Information Society, Internal Market, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Energy&#xd;<br />Energy Security&#xd;<br />Energy efficiency&#xd;<br />Post-2020 CO2 Transport Emissions &#xd;<br />Renewables &amp; Biofuels&#xd;<br />Cyber Security&#xd;<br />Digital Agenda&#xd;<br />Digital Single Market &amp; Connected Continent&#xd;<br />Big Data&#xd;<br />Towards a thriving data-driven economy &#xd;<br />Common European Data Protection Reform&#xd;<br />E-Privacy Directive &#xd;<br />Review of 2009 Telecoms Framework&#xd;<br />Ultra High Frequency Radio Spectrum&#xd;<br />Natural Resources&#xd;<br />Industrial Renaissance&#xd;<br />EU Enlargement &#xd;<br />Homeland Security&#xd;<br />Comprehensive European Security Agenda&#xd;<br />Border Management (Schengen)&#xd;<br />Critical Infrastructure Protection&#xd;<br />Transport&#xd;<br />Automotive&#xd;<br />Connected Vehicles&#xd;<br />eCall &#xd;<br />Connecting Europe Facility &#xd;<br />Regional Development&#xd;<br />Horizon 2020&#xd;<br />R&amp;D&#xd;<br />CSR","lastUp":"2017-04-26T10:21:47.286+01:00","customers":"Amway","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"400000-499999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":"500000-999999"}
