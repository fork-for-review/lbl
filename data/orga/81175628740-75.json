The objectives of the Association are to protect its members’ interests with regard to industrial and employment issues, and to play an active role in respect of shared concerns in the industry. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The NSA's history is a century-long journey, but this history began long before the foundation of the NSA in 1909. Norway has always been a maritime nation; shipping is an important part of our identity - and is a key aspect of Norwegian industry, settlement and employment. The maritime industries account for more than seven percent of value creation in Norway and now represent a vital, rounded and competitive industrial cluster.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The shipowners and offshore companies are the core of this industrial cluster. As an employers’ and professional organisation for its member companies, the NSA’s objective is to realise the added value inherent in a communality of focus, to the benefit of the industry and the individual member. It is our aim to translate our members’ value-creation, ability to innovate, power and influence – and Norway’s overall maritime status and reputation – into effective action in the industry’s interests, both nationally and internationally.","acronym":"NSA","interests":"Climate Action, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Customs, Economic and Financial Affairs, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Home Affairs, Internal Market, Public Health, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"COM2013(480) MRV, EU energy and climate policy, COM2013(296) market access/financial transparency of ports, ship recycling, sulphur, seafarers rights, Blue Belt/reduction of administrative burdens, state aid guidelines, boat migrants and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, social rights, legal affairs.","lastUp":"2017-04-05T09:54:23.216+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
