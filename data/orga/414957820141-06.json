OASC aims to kickstart the use of a shared set of ways to develop systems once for multiple cities and make them interoperable between cities, and within a city. Simple, functional, minimal de facto standard ways of accessing and exchanging data have the potential to take smart city innovation beyond the limits of the current chicken-and-egg situation where no systems can scale and spread because there are no standards, and there are no standards because there is no widespread deployment.&#xd;<br />As such, the initial proposed mechanisms are neither exclusive nor singular. For a city, it means that it is possible to implement the proposed mechanisms on top of and in addition to existing systems or future systems to be procured, without being intrusive in their internal architecture. Consequently, the cost associated with the implementation is very limited and the flexibility is high. On the other hand, security, safety and stability can be handled within existing procedures and reaching required levels in a publicly-facing production environment.&#xd;<br />The specific mechanisms proposed are pragmatic and simple, intended to be powerful enough to support the exchange that is needed, yet simple, so that they do not create a considerable overhead in terms of resources, and based on free licenses, so that they do not tie city development to a specific vendor or technology.","acronym":"OASC","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Audiovisual and Media, Budget, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"- Digital Single Market.&#xd;<br />- Standardisation.&#xd;<br />- European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities.&#xd;<br />- Urban Agenda.&#xd;<br />- Digital entrepreneurship.","lastUp":"2017-11-30T17:41:44.168+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
