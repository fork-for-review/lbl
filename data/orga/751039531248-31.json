The project is financially supported by the Research Council of Norway with up to 78,4 million NOK over the up to 8-year project period. The Certus Centre formally started operations 1 October 2011 with status as a Centre for Research-based Innovation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Certus Centre has made a strong impact in the global software engineering community in the areas of variability testing, modelling highly configurable systems, and testing data-intensive systems. Software engineers and researchers have teamed up to create an innovative environment where specialised expertise and creative research combine to produce readily exploitable, takeaway results. Certus has issued a number of high-quality publications and developed several software prototype tools, such as the TITAN tool and the Zen-RUCM editor. Another highlight of Certus' production is the experimental application of our techniques in industrial case studies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Certus has three core expertise fields:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Model-based engineering for highly configurable systems:&#xd;<br />Involving the application of model driven engineering techniques to the modelling and configuration of subsea integrated control systems, which can be regarded as highly variable software systems. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Testing of data-intensive systems:&#xd;<br />Looking into the improvement of existing regression testing techniques to handle large database-centric applications.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Testing of real-time embedded systems: &#xd;<br />Involving research into managing the testing activities of families of realtime embedded systems.","acronym":"CERTUS","interests":"Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"AI, software engineering, machine learning, research policies, education, Horizon 2020, IoT","lastUp":"2018-04-18T15:03:05.282+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
