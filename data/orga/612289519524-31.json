Its goal is to understand the implications of sustainability for investors and support signatories to incorporate these issues into their investment decision making and ownership practices.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In implementing the Principles, signatories contribute to the development of a more sustainable global financial system.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Principles are voluntary and aspirational. They offer a menu of possible actions for incorporating ESG issues into investment practices across asset classes. Responsible investment is a process that must be tailored to fit each organisationâ€™s investment strategy, approach and resources. The Principles are designed to be compatible with the investment styles of large, diversified, institutional investors that operate within a traditional fiduciary framework.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The PRI Initiative has quickly become the leading global network for investors to publicly demonstrate their commitment to responsible investment, to collaborate and learn with their peers about the financial and investment implications of ESG issues, and to incorporate these factors into their investment decision making and ownership practices.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Six Principles&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Principle 1: We will incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes.&#xd;<br />Principle 2: We will be active owners and incorporate ESG issues into our ownership policies and practices.&#xd;<br />Principle 3: We will seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest.&#xd;<br />Principle 4: We will promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry.&#xd;<br />Principle 5: We will work together to enhance our effectiveness in implementing the Principles.&#xd;<br />Principle 6: We will each report on our activities and progress towards implementing the Principles.","acronym":"PRI","interests":"Climate Action, Economic and Financial Affairs, Energy, Environment, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union ","euInitiatives":"International Observert to EU HLEG&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />See: www.unpri.org/publications and www.fiduciaryduty21.org&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century&#xd;<br />- Fiduciary Duty German and UK roadmaps&#xd;<br />- The Case for Public Policy Engagement&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />See: http://www.unpri.org/areas-of-work/policy-and-research/briefing-papers-events-news/&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- EU Revision of the Shareholder Rights Directive.&#xd;<br />- EU IORP ii Directive","lastUp":"2017-09-13T10:42:22.126+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
