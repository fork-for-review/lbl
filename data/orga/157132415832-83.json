SELC uses the power of the law and policy to protect the environment in six southern US states:  Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.  Our attorneys work in all branches and at all levels of US and state government to defend healthy air and clean water; our forests, coasts, and wetlands; our scenic countryside; and the special character of our communities.  When international policies and practices threaten the natural environment of SELCâ€™s 6-state, southern-US region, SELC is prepared to challenge these threats.  Working with regional, national, and international partner organizations, SELC advocates for sound international policy that will protect the valuable resources of the southeastern U.S.","acronym":"SELC","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment","euInitiatives":"Climate, Energy, Environment","lastUp":"2017-03-03T16:56:11.960+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
