This ageing has also brought challenges in terms of a new order of complexity in ensuring the health of the ageing populations. Geriatric medicine has developed to meet this challenge, and has been proven to be an efficient and cost-effective development.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />A number of organisations have been supporting a European profile for geriatric medicine and momentum has been building up over the last decade. It was felt, however, that there was still a lack of a central focus for continuing professional development and academic matters in the European Union.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The first group met to discuss the EUGMS in Sept 1999 in Paris. After a number of meetings at different European cities, the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society was finally created, and was launched in Paris in August 2001, when its 1 st Congress took place.","acronym":"EUGMS","interests":"Public Health","euInitiatives":"European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP - AHA)&#xd;<br />HORIZON 2020 competition, call INT-3-2015, Europeâ€™s contribution to a value-based global order and its contestants.","lastUp":"2017-04-06T17:36:23.621+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
