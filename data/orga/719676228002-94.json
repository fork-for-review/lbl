With an open and dialogue based approach to cultural cooperation, we seek to foster intercultural understanding.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Our work is founded on a broad conceptual platform that embraces art, culture and society; within those areas we work for a common ground that unites people across cultures and national borders, promotes international understanding and facilitates intercultural communication.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Danish Cultural Institute facilitates networks and strengthens collaboration between Danish and international artists, cultural institutions and the creative sectors.
