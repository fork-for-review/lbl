Lack of information, corruption, outdated legislation, unfair intermediation in the coal market - all this hampers effective interaction between the supplier and the consumer. To restore this essential relationship, our team creates the first decentralized market for coal fuel and its cryptoactive - CoalCoin. Ecosystem CoalCoin allows in 2 clicks to find coal of the right brand from the nearest supplier, make a deal and carry out logistics.","acronym":"CC","interests":"Communication, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Energy, Environment, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Research and Technology, Trade, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Energy Union strategy, EU energy and climate strategy till 2030;&#xd;<br />Clean Energy for All Europeans Package&#xd;<br />Electricity market design and relates issues;&#xd;<br />bilateral EU-Ukraine energy cooperation and support on energy reforms in Ukraine;&#xd;<br />Energy Community activities;&#xd;<br />Revision of the directives on security of supply on gas and electricity;&#xd;<br />Energy efficiency (whole range of issues);&#xd;<br />Climate and ETS reform;&#xd;<br />Renewable energy regulation and integration into the market;&#xd;<br />integration of the Ukrainian energy system into the European market","lastUp":"2018-01-13T09:43:20.686+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
