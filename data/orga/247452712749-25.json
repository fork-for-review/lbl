As democracy and free markets evolved, so new interest groups and policy processes developed, together with an emerging need for professional and transparent public affairs advice. Our clients needed the confidence that they were being served by Western-oriented and credible public affairs professionals.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As we have grown, we have relied on seeking out the best in local consultants, management and staff. Our offices now employ over 40 people across the region and we continue to grow into new markets through using tested and professional consultants and partner agencies. We combine senior management that has years of experience in the region between them, with young, dynamic, and multilingual staff to service your needs professionally and effectively.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Central European countries now play a crucial role in shaping the Brussels agenda, both through their national government representatives, and through their MEPs. Under the Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has an even greater role in shaping the long-term legislative environment of Central Europe. CEC helps you understand the new Central European players in the EU, and to access them effectively by leveraging our own two-decades long presence in the region.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We have remained fiercely independent over the years, but we have also invested time in developing a network of relationships with partner public affairs and public relations companies in Europe, the UK and the United States. We are delighted to be able to team with them on the increasing number of pan-European campaigns directed at Brussels in which we are asked to participate.","acronym":"CEC GR","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Climate Action, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Information Society, Internal Market, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Climate &amp; Energy Policy&#xd;<br />Transport Policy&#xd;<br />Financial Services&#xd;<br />Digital Europe","lastUp":"2017-04-03T12:15:38.491+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":"0-99999"}
