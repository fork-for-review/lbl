Letting our voices be heard by the key people involved in the EU legislation process!&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />    Lobbying: The Food sector has become one of the most heavily regulated in the European Union, with an increasing number of Regulations directly addressing consumers and businesses of each Member State. It is in Brussels that the EU Institutions, the politics and the agro food business decide the future of our food system and it is in this city that the Safe Food Advocacy Europe association (SAFE) should build a serious lobbying transparency strategy. Too many  lobbyist work in Brussels to defend interests of the agro food business. The food industries is focusing on business interest and not on consumer health. Therefore professional lobbyists will work for SAFE and they will be in close contact with all key persons involved in the EU legislation process, including Members of the European Parliament, officials of the European Commission, attaché of Permanent Representation to the EU etc… Transparency will be crucial in our lobbying strategy and our voice will be heard.&#xd;<br />    Informing: organization of seminars, training for consumers concerning reading food labels (the meanings of E650 or E450), additives, colors, pesticides and GMO.
