These colonies can then find their own solutions to climate change, diseases, and pests. These colonies are \"unmanaged honey bees\".&#xd;<br />At the same time, some colonies will continue to be kept by humans in beehives of all shapes and sizes with human management and human selective breeding. These colonies are \"managed honey bees\".&#xd;<br />Honey Bee Wild, a group of volunteers, organises events and activities that will contribute to changes to allow honey bees to live with as little human intervention as possible.","acronym":"HBW","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Food Safety, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trade","euInitiatives":"Pollinators; Apis mellifera; Honey bees; EU Pollinators Initative; Habitats Directive; Natura 2000","lastUp":"2018-04-02T08:23:35.389+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
