TransferWise is the cheapest and fairest way of transferring money internationally. We’re making sure that it’s our customers that benefit and not the banking system.","acronym":"","interests":"Competition, Consumer Affairs, Economic and Financial Affairs, Enterprise, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Information Society, Internal Market","euInitiatives":"The Payment Services Directives, Electronic Money Directive, Anti-Money Laundering Directive, Cross-Border Payments Regulation, Single European Payments Area, General Data Protection Regulation","lastUp":"2017-05-23T15:23:35.648+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
