TransferWise is the cheapest and fairest way of transferring money internationally. We’re making sure that it’s our customers that benefit and not the banking system.","acronym":"","interests":"Banking and financial services, Business and Industry, Competition, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Single market","euInitiatives":"The Payment Services Directives, Electronic Money Directive, Anti-Money Laundering Directive, Cross-Border Payments Regulation, Single European Payments Area, General Data Protection Regulation","lastUp":"2018-04-30T15:00:46.274+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
