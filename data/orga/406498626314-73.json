However, there is a dearth of knowledge about, and little understanding of, how regional political changes affect the everyday lives and needs of the region’s people. The world has celebrated the rising stars of the “Arab Spring” revolutions and appreciated their contributions to bringing about change, but many others remain unrecognized, their grievances marginalized or ignored. With the support of our deeply knowledgeable and extensive network of actors in the region, TIMEP is committed to having these marginalized voices be acknowledged. The analyses provided by TIMEP will particularly aim to connect those outside the region with local knowledge and perspectives. By harnessing the extensive regional expertise of its staff—along with that of its expansive network of on-the-ground experts and activists—TIMEP will contribute significantly to the national dialogue concerning the Middle East and thereby promote well-founded policy in the region.","acronym":"TIMEP Europe","interests":"Enlargement, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Home Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Justice and Fundamental Rights","euInitiatives":"Work of the Mashreq and Mahreb delegation of the European Parliament&#xd;<br />EU Policy towards the Southern Neighbourhood&#xd;<br />EU Policy towards Migration&#xd;<br />EU Policy towards Terrorism&#xd;<br />EU Policy towards Integration &#xd;<br />Human Rights&#xd;<br />Freedom of Religion","lastUp":"2018-02-28T11:52:11.138+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
