We identify investors and financiers of the entire spectrum ranging from private investors, family offices, foundations, social investors and banks. We put an emphasis on combining several investors with different financing components in order to develop innovative financing approaches that can serve as role models for the social finance sector. We focus on the social and environmental impact of our projects and seek to advance the social finance sector. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our mission is to assist social enterprises with outstanding concepts in finding appropriate financing. Through our coaching and consulting we want to enable social enterprises to finance significant growth steps across the often rigid boundaries between donors, investors and the public sector. Thereby, we want to overcome one of the most pressing obstacles to the spread of social innovation in Germany and Europe. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />To coach social entrepreneurs to grow and expand their social impact, we support them with two different services: &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />(i) Preparation towards investment readiness&#xd;<br />We coach social entrepreneurs to become investment-ready. Therefore, we coach them to develop and sharpen their business model and business plan towards financial plausibility from the point of view of investors. Additionally, we identify the appropriate financial instruments to structure their financial needs (e.g., equity, debt, and mezzanine) and develop financial concepts on how to integrate various investors. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />(ii) Consultancy in all questions of planning, preparation and conclusion of a financing round&#xd;<br />Together with the social entrepreneur, we develop suggestions concerning the financing strategy and the appropriate financing mix of different financing instruments (e.g., equity, debt, and mezzanine). We support social entrepreneurs with the compilation of all necessary documents for the transaction process of raising growth capital (e.g. investment teaser, investment memorandum). We coach them to select and address the right investors from different ?financing planets? (e.g. business angels, social investors, banks, foundations, private investors) and actively build coalitions between different types of investors to enable financing rounds that would otherwise not have been possible. Additionally, we manage the entire transaction process of raising growth capital from the initial planning to the final closing. We also support social entrepreneurs during the contract negotiations with potential investors.","acronym":"FASE","interests":"Employment and Social Affairs","euInitiatives":"Social Business Initiative (SBI)&#xd;<br />Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI)","lastUp":"2017-02-21T17:46:14.269+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
