The organization replaces the European Betting Association building on the strong foundations laid since EBA’s start in 2003. EBA has been acknowledged by authorities throughout Europe as a strong voice bringing to the forefront national and European debates regarding the rights of regulated European-licensed operators to offer cross-border services. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In the footsteps of EBA, EGBA aims at promoting the implementation at European level of a competitive, fair and regulated market accessible to operators applying high-level standards with regard to consumer and minor protection as well as other aspects of responsible gaming. The EGBA believes that consumers should have access to a greater choice of regulated European operators and access to the highest possible standards in protection and care, which is more likely to be achieved through regulated competition than in a monopoly environment.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EGBA groups the leading cross-border online gaming and betting operators fully established and licensed in Europe, several of which are publicly listed. All the members  of EGBA abide by a Code of Conduct and strict standards that include:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-KYC and the prevention of underage or problem gambling; &#xd;<br />-A zero tolerance approach to fraud or criminal behavior &#xd;<br />strict safeguards for client privacy and security of information &#xd;<br />- Prompt payment policies&#xd;<br />- Rigorous and independent assessment of games fairness &#xd;<br />- Responsible and ethical marketing practice &#xd;<br />- Efficient and professional business conduct and a commitment to customer satisfaction and support.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />These standards do not replace the existing legal requirements already imposed by various EU licensing jurisdictions but are additional to these requirements and are compulsory to all EGBA members. EGBA’s commitment to a transparent and regulated industry is reinforced by a rigorous independent audit that is annually performed on EGBA Members to ensure full compliance with the code of conduct and standards.","acronym":"EGBA","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Enterprise, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Sport","euInitiatives":"Communication on online gambling, (Digital) single market, all policies related to gambling","lastUp":"2017-02-23T12:09:39.040+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
