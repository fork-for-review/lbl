The aims of the Scheme are to:&#xd;<br />- Provide assurance for investors about the environmental integrity of climate bonds.&#xd;<br />- Provide governments with an easy-to-use tool to prioritize investments that address their climate change policy imperatives.&#xd;<br />- Support liquidity for climate bonds in secondary markets, as secondary markets are a pre-requisite for attracting institutional investors to the climate bonds market.","acronym":"CBI","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Economic and Financial Affairs, Energy, Environment, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Transport","euInitiatives":"Capital Markets Union, Juncker Plan&#xd;<br />High-level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance&#xd;<br />Standards and certification for green bonds&#xd;<br />Climate Bonds taxonomy","lastUp":"2017-04-25T16:24:40.372+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
