Giventis received its initial funding from the European Commission to study the economic benefits from collaboration. The result: Giventis-ELG Collaborative Networks and ELG-Web, Europe’s premier Internet platform for automated transport network collaboration and optimization.&#xd;<br />The platform offers carriers, forwarders and shippers visibility to flows across their entire extended network, including divisions and multiple locations. It captures and manages all carrier lane data in one place; it continuously optimizes capacity internally and across partners, identifying round trips and continuous moves, enabling more cost efficient use of vehicles and drivers.&#xd;<br />The Giventis platform will enable transport operators to create and manage private networks internally across divisions, and along with external partners, give them the capability to pool capacity for joint operations. Shippers can use the same capabilities to build their own trusted networks to source transportation. &#xd;<br />The end result: less empty kilometers driven, translating to reduced CO2 emissions. Transport operators can increase operating margins while improving air quality.  &#xd;<br />As a secure, Internet based software service, transport operators can have full access to the platform’s capabilities without the expense and resources of maintaining transport management software on-site; it is a light, user friendly, fast and very powerful tool.","acronym":"Giventis","interests":"Environment, Transport","euInitiatives":"Horizon 2020 - NexTrust&#xd;<br />Horizon 2020 - AEOLIX","lastUp":"2017-02-10T17:43:15.482+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"400000-499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
