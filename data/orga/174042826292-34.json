We provide civil society with skills, knowledge and network to advocate, inform, campaign and investigate cases where public and private officials are complicit in the illicit removal of public goods to private accounts and private ownership across country borders. We also ensure that civil society can be an active voice in ensuring the return and monitoring the use of confiscated stolen assets. We campaign against individuals and the structures that enable asset theft, we support cross-border civil society cooperation on asset recovery and we develop the expertise of civil society to be strong voices across the globe on asset theft.","acronym":"CiFAR","interests":"External Relations, Justice and Fundamental Rights","euInitiatives":"5th Money Laundering Directive&#xd;<br />Council Asset Freezes","lastUp":"2017-06-09T18:15:06.613+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
