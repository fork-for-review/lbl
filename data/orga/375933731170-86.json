A major focus is on optimising the impact and exploitation of knowledge and ideas. There is a great wealth of publicly funded academic research waiting to be turned into products, services and solutions that create market value benefitting the economy and society.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our activities are mainly taking place in the environment of the EU institutions with a strong foothold in the European Parliament. Within the activities of the K4I Forum in the European Parliament, supported by 40 MEPs, we have been organising more than 500 debates and 9 successful European Innovation Summit events in the European Parliament in Brussels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />.","acronym":"K4I","interests":"Education, Energy, Regional Policy, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"Horizon 2020&#xd;<br />FP9&#xd;<br />Digital policy &#xd;<br />Regional Policy&#xd;<br />Research and Innovation policies","lastUp":"2018-04-12T15:43:31.421+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
