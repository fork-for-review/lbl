Orchid Project is working to end FGC through partnering with grassroots organisations, sharing, and advocacy.The three strands of our work aim to accelerate and catalyse an end to FGC around the world, and change is already happening.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />PARTNERS&#xd;<br />Orchid Project partners with inspirational grassroots organisations that are promoting an end to&#xd;<br />FGC through non-directive, human rights-led approaches. Together with our partners, we believe in respectful, non-judgemental community dialogue around issues of FGC. We currently support partners working within communities in Kenya, India, Senegal and West Africa.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />SHARING&#xd;<br />Orchid Project catalyses the abandonment of&#xd;<br />FGC globally by sharing knowledge between our partners and across the wider movement. We disseminate research and best practice through our Knowledge Sharing Workshops, which bring representatives together to learn and create networks of local organisations working to end FGC. Orchid Project also supports global activists and grassroots partners to attend the Tostan Training Centre in Senegal to understand how change can happen.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ADVOCACY&#xd;<br />We advocate globally to governments and decision makers to ensure that ending FGC is a priority. Orchid Project believes that FGC can only end&#xd;<br />with the help of stakeholders at every level; from community members, to regional, national and international actors. We make the case for FGC to be represented in frameworks and policies, as it is in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, and for work to be fully resourced.","acronym":"","interests":"European Neighbourhood Policy, External Relations, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development","euInitiatives":"Orchid Project follows and seeks to contribute positively to the EU's International Cooperation and Development policy and programming.
