The objective of AIPPI is to improve and promote the protection of IP on both an international and national basis. It pursues this objective by working for the development, expansion and improvement of international and regional treaties and agreements and also of national laws relating to IP. It operates by conducting studies of existing national laws and proposes measures to achieve harmonization of these laws on an international basis. In this context AIPPI has become increasingly concerned with issues concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights.","acronym":"AIPPI","interests":"Climate Action, Competition, Customs, Development, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and Technology, Trade","euInitiatives":"Intellectual Property including Patents (Unitary Patent/Unified Patent Court), Trademarks, Designs, Copyright, Unfair Competition, and Enforcement of Intellecutal Property Rights","lastUp":"2017-03-22T15:20:26.727+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
