To this end, the IFSP participates in consultations on new proposed laws, regulations and directives, but also takes suggestions for necessary changes directly to the authorities, where it sees the opportunity for improvement or for the smoother operation of existing processes.&#xd;<br />The IFSP also seeks to inform its members of any changes being introduced, and to foster discussion on issues in financial services and best practice through seminars.&#xd;<br />Where it sees a gap in commercial provision, it also organises professional education and training courses for both members and non-members.","acronym":"IFSP","interests":"Communication, Competition, Customs, Economic and Financial Affairs, Enterprise, Environment, Information Society, Internal Market, Regional Policy, Taxation, Transport","euInitiatives":"AIFMD; 4th Money Laundering Directive; Capital Markets Union; Financial Transaction Tax; CCCTB","lastUp":"2018-02-19T10:30:22.002+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
