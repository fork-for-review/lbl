We do this by promoting the transparent, accountable and sustainable management of oil, gas and minerals so that they contribute to prosperity for all.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We engage at all stages of the extractive sector value chain to support research and promote training, learning and access to information by citizens.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our coalition is made up of more than 700 member organisations and 41 national coalitions across the world, including human rights, development, environmental and faith-based organisations.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />All our members and coalitions have to adhere to Publish What You Pay’s principles and standards.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are guided by the belief that coordinating the collective actions, skills and interest of a diverse coalition of civil society organisations is the most effective way to influence key stakeholders and drive change in the extractive industries and the governmental sector.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The coalition is supported by a Secretariat and governed by various bodies, for more information visit our website.
