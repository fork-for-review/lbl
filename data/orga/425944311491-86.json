This results in our regular participation to meetings (plenary and scientific) of RFMOs, in our close cooperation with scientists related to the provision of data or research programs, in a dialog and even cooperation with NGOs that want to get involved in the sector to improve best practices and, finally, in ORTHONGEL's implication in organizations that contribute to the sustainable management of stocks or that promote good environmental and social practices.","acronym":"ORTHONGEL","interests":"Fisheries and Aquaculture","euInitiatives":"Reform of the external dimension of the CFP&#xd;<br />FAR regulation &#xd;<br />Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements&#xd;<br />RFMOs' regulations","lastUp":"2017-02-16T16:05:42.351+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
