This has drawn us to areas that span the biosphere: climate, oceans, ecosystems and health. Since these topics are intertwined, our solutions take a multidisciplinary approach. We work in concert with other organizations — as well as with business, government and communities — and avoid duplicating work already being done effectively by others.","acronym":"EDF","interests":"Environment, External Relations, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Common Fisheries Policy, EMFF, Technical Measures, Landing Obligation and Omnibus Regulation.","lastUp":"2017-04-28T20:45:58.844+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
