Nata Libera offers the necessary specialised treatment and suitable environments to various species of animals that have been abandoned, suffered cruelty or  have been injured. in the case of wild animals, our highest ambition is to preserve their natural instincts in order to reintroduce them into the wild, as soon as physical conditions permit.","acronym":"nata libera","interests":"Climate Action, Education, Environment","euInitiatives":"LIFE MED WOLF&#xd;<br />LIFE PLUTO&#xd;<br />LIFE WOLFALPS","lastUp":"2017-09-29T09:50:25.022+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
