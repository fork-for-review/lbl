Similar principles as were central to the debate in the Enlightenment period should again be at the basis of developing the potential that digital technology promises for the 21st century:&#xd;<br />•sharing of information and knowledge&#xd;<br />•respect for the freedom of choice of the citizen as a prerequisite for a flourishing and creative relation between humans and technology and for society as a whole&#xd;<br />•scientific and intellectual inquiry and open debate in service to all.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since the establishment of DEF in 2011 we have seen a rapid development shifting the debate from individuals using new and convenient technology to the effects on these individuals and society of this technology.&#xd;<br />DEF aims at stimulating and guiding a multi-disciplinary discussion related to the effects on digitisation on society. It is independent and involves a network of scientists and experts in technology, industry and policy.","acronym":"DigEnlight","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"All files that relate to digitisation and society, including:&#xd;<br />- Digital Agenda&#xd;<br />- Data Protection and Privacy&#xd;<br />- Cyber Security&#xd;<br />- Human rights and Surveillance&#xd;<br />- Digital Ethics&#xd;<br />- Trusted digital services&#xd;<br />- Net Neutrality&#xd;<br />- Internet Goivernance","lastUp":"2017-12-11T10:20:32.930+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
