The NCI gives a voice to independent, owner-managed firms that are entirely focused on and aligned with the interests of their clients and investors.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Over the last decade, an old fashioned “client-centric” approach has enabled entrepreneurial firms in the Square Mile and beyond to emerge as a growing force in a financial industry dominated by global financial giants. Now, more so than ever, these firms play a key role in preserving the stability and long-term focus of the financial sector, which is of benefit to society at large.","acronym":"NCI","interests":"Economic and Financial Affairs, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union ","euInitiatives":"MiFID II, UCITS, ELTIFs, FTT.","lastUp":"2017-05-02T14:53:26.368+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
