The term “natural” refers to the production process used by ENSA members to produce food using whole soybeans. Soy food products from ENSA members are produced without any use of GM (genetically modified) material or GM beans. The founding principle of ENSA combines a belief in natural soy products and the use of sound science. ENSA seeks to raise awareness among EU citizens and promote the consumption of natural soy products, which are an integral part of a healthy balanced lifestyle. ENSA also supports soy growing in Europe and engages in the wider plant base debate.","acronym":"ENSA","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Consumer Affairs, Environment, Food Safety, Public Health, Taxation","euInitiatives":"The main focus areas of ENSA in EU public affairs are: health and nutrition, labelling, sustainable development, environment and taxation.","lastUp":"2017-03-10T14:49:23.971+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
