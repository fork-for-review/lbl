Quality, involvement and clarity underpin our&#xd;<br />educational approach.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />To provide world-class academic research&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />At Radboud University we create a lively, successful&#xd;<br />research community, generating new insights and&#xd;<br />ideas which contribute to social, cultural and economic&#xd;<br />development across the full spectrum of our academic&#xd;<br />disciplines, both nationally and internationally. Research&#xd;<br />feeds back into education; this close connection between&#xd;<br />education and research is the most important aspect of&#xd;<br />our pursuit of excellence.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Research quality&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />• The research at the University is trend-setting internationally, and this is reflected in good&#xd;<br />scores for fundraising and publications in high-impact-factor journals.&#xd;<br />• All research (following the new Standard Evaluation Protocol for assessments of scientific&#xd;<br />research in the Netherlands) is evaluated as at least ‘very good’; research groups that do not&#xd;<br />meet this standard are phased out.&#xd;<br />• The University creates scope for excellent, curiosity-driven research.&#xd;<br />• Our academic infrastructure and research data are made available to other knowledgeintensive&#xd;<br />organisations.&#xd;<br />• ICT facilities for researchers are sufficiently robust:&#xd;<br />◊ Our Research Data Management (RDM) programme and rollouts of digital scientific&#xd;<br />information have been completed.&#xd;<br />◊ Research systems such as RDM/RDS, Metis, and the Radboud Repository have been&#xd;<br />integrated, in order to create a coherent environment for saving, sharing and unlocking&#xd;<br />research information and data. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Societal Impact&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are intensifying our collaboration&#xd;<br />with a range of social partners. There is&#xd;<br />increasing demand from society – as well&#xd;<br />as political pressure – for research results&#xd;<br />to be useful socially and economically.&#xd;<br />Fewer investments in scientific research&#xd;<br />are being made by the business community,&#xd;<br />while the government is encouraging a shift&#xd;<br />from public to private funding in higher&#xd;<br />education. Universities are competing&#xd;<br />intensively to secure collaboration with&#xd;<br />private partners. Given the financial&#xd;<br />importance of such collaborations, issues&#xd;<br />such as the need to avoid possible conflicts&#xd;<br />of interest, legal liability and reputation&#xd;<br />management are coming into sharper focus.","acronym":"SKU","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Audiovisual and Media, Budget, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Our organisation is following/monitoring:&#xd;<br />EU Higher Education Policy; Horizon 2020; European Research Area; EU Research Policy;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Main activities:&#xd;<br />- research and innovation&#xd;<br />- education&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Main areas of interest:&#xd;<br />Astrophysics &#xd;<br />Business and Law &#xd;<br />Cyber Security &#xd;<br />Healthy Brain &#xd;<br />Human Genetics &#xd;<br />Infection and Immunology &#xd;<br />Linguistics &#xd;<br />Microbiology &#xd;<br />Organic Chemistry &#xd;<br />Solid State Physics","lastUp":"2018-03-29T11:09:17.634+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
