By creating and disseminating knowledge from research findings, ECRA's aim is to facilitate and accelerate innovation to guide the cement industry. &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />ECRA’s activities are pre-competitive and comprise seminars, workshops and dedicated research projects. Its seminars and workshops provide a platform for teaching the latest knowledge on cement and concrete technology and for communicating and discussing the latest research findings. The seminar programmes cover process and concrete-oriented issues of high concern to the cement industry. Some seminars are of specific interest to cement producers, while others provide information more important to cement associations.  &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />ECRA understands itself as part of a network which comprises various research facilities such as universities, federal institutes and the research centres of cement companies or equipment suppliers. In this context it is able to develop a knowledge centre which benefits from cooperation with the best institutes in the respective areas of research and acts as a core competence centre providing a broad platform for top researchers in each field.","acronym":"ECRA","interests":"Climate Action","euInitiatives":"1.\tREGULATION  (EU)  No  1291/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)   &#xd;<br />2.\tRegulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council  laying down com-mon provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Co-hesion &#xd;<br />      Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund&#xd;<br />3.\tREGULATION  (EU)  No  1292/2013  of the European Parliament and of the Council  amending Regulation  (EC)  No  294/2008  establishing the  European Institute of Innovation and Technology&#xd;<br />4.\tCommunication from the Commission: Towards an Integrated Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan: (C/2015/6317)","lastUp":"2018-03-21T08:21:05.035+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
