The ambition of the projects are to redesign the structure and the models of the Agriculture, Health and Transport industries and thus demonstrate to the world a practical example of eco-innovative systems which can help to radically improve quality of life, increase the economic prosperity and re-establish the harmony with the nature and the environment. We want to persuade the other industrial sectors as well as the public authorities, civil society and consumers  to take the direction towards smart resource management, optimized value chains, zero carbon footprint and nature preservation. We aim to bring to reality our slogan: “The awareness of the need to use the Earth and its fertility with care by the people who live on it!” through the latest innovative digital tools and to spread the message and concept of the circular economy among the society and the end-users. We want to go beyond minimizing the negative impact of the linear industry - we aim to effectively redesign it into a circular one. In order to reach this goal the EICE project will adopt novel concepts of coordinated and cluster-based development of circular business models and fill the gap between the value chain of the different industrial sectors. The benefits of the reuse of durables are already established in the economy. We thrive to go further and rediscover the circular model even also non-durable products and consumer goods – such as food and beverages and their packaging – which are short-lived and often transformed during use. In this perspective the economic benefits of a circular design are more complex in origin and harder to assess therefore the software the platform and the analytical tools will help us assess to resolve the hurdles of the linear model. GBOB is a unique non profit entity which brings together international as well local and regional Governments, individual farmers, existing bio organic producers, national and international experts and associated supply chain equipment suppliers. To secure a better world our organization is focused  on development and research in the  circular economy models. Our linear economy needs a new thriving story, A story that tells us how to develop a circular eco-economy where synergy provides us with the best of our earth namely a world with a health clean environment powered by its natural forces. GBOB Support of eco-development that respect the quality of the environment and its biodiversity and allows for collective social, cultural and economical enrichment. Apply integrated analytical approaches in respect of different uses of the territory that hinge on past or ongoing reflections, with socially responsible forms of economical development, in harmony with the land, people who live on it and its biodiversity. Residual or “waste” heat and energy recuperation. Waste is not just waste, but also a valuable source of energy. It would be a pity to let the heat lost released during combustion. Encourage diverse agricultural practices that retain biological nutrients and build natural capital. Ensure that organic products are optimized through energy and material cascades. GBOB creates interactive links between the communities, education science and the industry. We Create a health socioeconomic status this will reflect positive by example on: &#xd;<br />●\teducation&#xd;<br />●\tfinancial prosperity&#xd;<br />●\thealth&#xd;<br />●\thousing&#xd;<br />●\tmedical care&#xd;<br />●\tphysical activity&#xd;<br />●\tskill development&#xd;<br />●\tresponsibility&#xd;<br />●\tsocial activity&#xd;<br />●\twork exposures &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our planer need new design concepts to radically influence quality of life, universally ,  in conjunction with economic prosperity and yet live. in harmony with the nature and the environment. Coupling economic growth with environmental impact and increasing positive social outcomes shall lie at the heart of the corporate strategy of the participants in the sectoral clusters.","acronym":"GBOB","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Audiovisual and Media, Budget, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"European Innovation Partnership for Agricultural productivity and Sustainability (EIP-AGRI).
