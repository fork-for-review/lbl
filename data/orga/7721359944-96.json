IBM offers a wide range of technology and consulting services; a broad portfolio of middleware for collaboration, predictive analytics, software development and systems management; and the world's most advanced servers and supercomputers. Utilizing its business consulting, technology and R&amp;D expertise, IBM helps clients become \"smarter\" as the planet becomes more digitally interconnected. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />IBM in Europe:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />IBM has been investing in Europe for over 100 years, starting in Germany in 1910. The company operates today across the EU. The company has had a strong presence in Central and Eastern Europe since the Czech office opened in 1932.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />IBM is just as much at home in Europe as anywhere else in the world. For more than a century, we have been working in Europe on innovation that matters to Europeans. Four of our European-based lab scientists have been awarded Nobel prizes for physics and many of the 8,088 patents received in 2017 were filed at the European Patent Office in Munich.&#xd;<br />IBM is present all across Europe and our team here is as large as our team in the United States. We continue to invest in Europe: in cutting-edge research and new data center facilities, creating jobs across the continent and fostering a new generation of scientists and technology experts. IBM plays an active role in Europe’s digital ecosystem, partnering and sharing resources, technology and know-how with start-ups and SMEs, enabling them to be more competitive and innovative. Having been actively involved in the EU’s FP7 research programme, we are now launching collaboration in numerous Horizon 2020 projects which started in 2014. IBM has been involved in 43 funded projects, with more than 500 partners and has received 7 European Research Council grants – all in an effort to create and innovate for the benefit of Europeans. In Europe, public services, governments and companies – large and small – work with us to provide more forward thinking, more effective, healthier and safer services to their citizens &amp; customers. &#xd;<br />In February 2017, IBM opened its global headquarters for Watson Internet of Things (IoT) in Munich. The Watson IoT HQ brings together over 1000 developers, engineers, consultants, researchers and scientists on a campus environment driving innovation with SMEs and start-ups, governments, schools and universities and investors.","acronym":"IBM","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Budget, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"As a major investor and employer in Europe, IBM has a wide interest in public policy.
