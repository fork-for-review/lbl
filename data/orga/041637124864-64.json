NAYO actively engages its youth partners through its four main clusters disseminating sector specific information and allowing youth partners to pursue common interests through consortiums among other things&#xd;<br />•To create a common platform to advocate for the concerns of Zimbabwean youth at National, Regional and International levels – NAYO is a membership driven youth association, that has partners active from the grassroot to the national and regional levels, NAYO utilizes this reach to champion the diverse advocacy and lobby issues pertinent to youth. Its reach to the regional and global levels connects the different advocacy issues to processes furthering thw realization of this. In addition NAYO utilizes the cluster system as advocacy and lobby fronts that champion thematic specific advocacy issues apart from the broader issues affecting youths.&#xd;<br />•To  build  the  capacity  of  partner  organisations  and  their  constituencies  to  effectively participate in community and national development processes – NAYO in its work has  strong capacity strengthening component that is targeted to youth partners and communities in foxus where active projects are running, this allows our youth partners to have the requisite acumen and skills to run sustainable programs whilst at the same time building the capacitiea of communities to self organize around development issues of concern.&#xd;<br />•To mobilize resources and support in order to enable the work of NAYO for the common good of young people in Zimbabwe – NAYO recognizes that to support youth work and programs there.is.need for targeted support to youth organizations, however for.most of them they lack the requisite skills and capacity to attract this funding.

This action is designed to strengthen the collective capacities of the CSOs in their role as stakeholders in national development; building on the strategic and comparative advantages of each CSO’s thematic area while emphasizing multi-stakeholder partnerships to increase the impact of individual results into collective developmental results. While acknowledging that CSOs in Zimbabwe are well organised if compared to other 4 in the region and on the continent, the project partners realise that their actions however remain disjointed; local CSOs still suffer from lack of coordination in terms of programmatic activities and at times compete for the same space rather than fostering collaboration leading to duplication and wastage of resources. The action supports the realisation of the 2014-2017 EU CSO Roadmap for Engagement and in particular notes the need to increase communication and interaction amongst CSOs through strengthening existing information sharing platforms and supporting innovative social media spaces.&#xd;<br />At the Global Level&#xd;<br />Enhancing Civil Society Role in Development Partnerships Post 2015 – Main applicant is IBON International on behalf of CSO Partnership for Development Effectiveness (CPDE), NAYO is co-applicant in the action on behalf of the CPDE Youth Sector. This action aims  to  ensure  significant  CSO  contribution  in  global and  regional  development  policy  arenas,  particularly  through  the  GPEDC  and  other  relevant  processes, with  focus  on  the  implementation  of  the  SDGs.  In  order  to  contribute  towards  this  over-all  objective,  it sets  out  the  following  immediate  objectives: 1.  Influence  favourable  policy  outcomes  in  Development  Partnerships  at  the  global  and  regional levels  through  institutionalising  CSO  participation,  and  advocating  enabling  environment  for CSOs,  and  aligning  development  frameworks  to  human  rights  based  approaches; and, 2.  Increase  CSO  capacity  to  contribute  and  monitor  DPs  and  Istanbul  Principles  implementation.","lastUp":"2017-12-04T14:50:51.941+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
