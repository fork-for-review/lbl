The organisational profile of APDES comprehends four lines of intervention that guide the developed projects: health, harm reduction and human rights; health education; social cohesion and employment; cooperation and development.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />All the tasks carried out follow successfully delineated work principles, such as research, participative methodologies, outreach intervention, advocacy, assessment and interdisciplinary approach.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Headquartered in Vila Nova de Gaia, APDES develops several activities in this municipality and cities like Porto, Barcelos, Guarda, Viseu, Setúbal and Lisbon. Since 2008, APDES has internationalised its scope of action and organised several initiatives in European countries, Cape Verde and Angola – a territory where the process of institutional formalisation of the Agency is currently being carried out, alongside intervention and training projects.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The affiliation of APDES with other organisations is quite extensive; APDES is the founding and constituent member of several national and international networks in the ambit of harm reduction associated with psychoactive drugs use, sex work, access to employment and human rights. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2011, after being recognised as a Non-governmental Development Organisation (NGDO) by the Camões I.P., APDES started to benefit from the status of public utility.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our goal is to decrease the risks associated with drug use and sexual activity; the possible negative consequences of these behaviours (at an individual or communitarian level) can be reduced through adequate interventions. Additionally, we focus on the research of more effective ways to protect our beneficiaries – sex workers, people who use drugs and others who are in a vulnerable social situation – as well as the communities they live in. Our main concern is to promote health and defend the human rights of those we work with, through projects designed with their active involvement - in order to guarantee the well-being and health of the participants.","acronym":"APDES","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Audiovisual and Media, Communication, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"Sex Work issues – dignifying the persons who have commercial sex activities; fighting the stigma associate to sex workers; promoting the well being; articulation with ILO for better work conditions and legislation reform to a more progressive one regarding the mater of Sex Work;&#xd;<br />Drug Policy issues – following the developments on NPS, the Early Warning System (balance between Law Enforcement and Health approaches), the challenges proposed by NPS regarding the evolution of the Legal framework around Europe; the debate in Europe about the Decriminalization Model (further steps); &#xd;<br />Cooperation for Development – evolution of the financial programmes to work with third countries; the European engagement with Africa and South America; articulation for a common understanding on Drug Policy with the South America countries (both State and Civil Society); Training and Education issues in African countries;&#xd;<br />Civil Society participation:&#xd;<br />- Participative involvement of civil society organisations in the development and protection of those who are more vulnerable;&#xd;<br />- Political participation of NGOs (civil society), key-actors in the pluralist and post-materialistic democracy – due to their institutional diversification and opposition to the traditional market and state institutions;&#xd;<br />- Creation of new social spaces, in order to favour the establishment of a civil society able to neutralise the neo-patrimonial strategies;&#xd;<br />- Combine the daily service provision with the mobilisation and awareness for social problems and pressure the states and national and international organisations, in order to modify policies and influence certain institutions – despite the scarcity of resources and time to carry out advocacy actions;&#xd;<br />- Promote a balanced power relation between governments, markets and citizens;&#xd;<br />- Issues regarding representativeness (lack of opportunities at a national level);&#xd;<br />- Limitations in the capacity-building of target-population and difficulty in remaining loyal to distinctive values, due to the NGOs’ growing professionalization and tendency to focus on services to ensure funding;&#xd;<br />- NGOs’ financial sustainability; NGOs act as services providers to the state, while attempting to establish an alternative agenda that does not interfere with their competences (in order to become legitimate agents of social change).","lastUp":"2017-12-17T16:32:32.879+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"400000-499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
