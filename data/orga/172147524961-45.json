Annually, it carries out about 150,000 FTL shipments and moves about three million tonnes of goods on the road across the whole of Europe. The supply chain management of such huge quantities of transport can only be achieved with suppliersâ€™ help. Therefore, ARC has subcontracted 35% of the road transportation to about 1.000 suppliers. The challenge is the planning of this network, requires legal contracts and dedicated resources with the support of several IT and multimedia means.","acronym":"Arcese","interests":"Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Free consulancy and technical expert for the transport and logistic sector at the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF)","lastUp":"2017-11-13T10:21:27.292+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
