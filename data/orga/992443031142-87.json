The members of NMPFâ€™s cooperatives produce the majority of the U.S. milk supply, making NMPF the voice of dairy producers on Capitol Hill and with government agencies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />NMPF provides a forum through which dairy farmers and their cooperatives formulate policy on national issues that affect milk production and marketing. NMPF's contribution to this policy is aimed at improving the economic interests of dairy farmers, thus assuring the nation's consumers an adequate supply of pure, wholesome, and nutritious milk and dairy products.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The policies of NMPF are determined by its members from across the nation. Therefore, the policy positions expressed by NMPF are the only nationwide expression of dairy farmers and their cooperatives on national public policy.","acronym":"NMPF","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Trade","euInitiatives":"NMPF follows EU agri-food dossiers, bilateral and multilateral trade policy","lastUp":"2018-04-11T10:01:29.733+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
