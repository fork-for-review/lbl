We also teach them basic business skills so they can take control of their own future and become independent entrepreneurs. &#xd;<br />We have already installed a pilot machine to produce peanuts oil and cake, in Senegal; two more cooperatives are starting the oil production, because we have installed the machines for two coopratives.&#xd;<br />- obstetric fistula (humanitarian project)&#xd;<br />we are installing 3 small hospitals in Senegal, Nigeria and Ivory Coast; with the contribution of our french team.&#xd;<br />For the women indipendence project we have involved the Senegal Governament, the ILO, the ABFD and several others institutions. We are working with the Italian Embassy in Dakar to involve the EU institutions, so we are preparing a complete business plan of the activity to introduce the document to the EU institutions.&#xd;<br />see also: http://www.idainternational.org/women-independance/project-launch/","lastUp":"2018-02-06T09:57:03.189+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
