The company has six European offices (Brussels, Zurich, London, Stockholm, Milan, Barcelona). The majority of our projects are carried out on a no-cure-no-pay basis. This means that we only invoice our services when and if the client receives public funding. This formula is particularly attractive for SMEs who wish to avoid high upfront payments and reduce the risk of failure.","acronym":"ZAZ","interests":"Climate Action, Communication, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, Public Health, Research and Technology, Transport","euInitiatives":"Horizon 2020 Funding Programme","lastUp":"2017-03-21T09:01:52.446+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":""}
