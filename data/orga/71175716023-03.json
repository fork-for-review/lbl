Our headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland. Our diverse employee base is made up of over 100 nationalities building careers at JTI that span our worldwide operations. We are a truly international business.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />JTI recognizes that cigarettes are a legal but controversial product. People smoke for pleasure but there are real risks that come with that pleasure. Accordingly JTI believes that tobacco products should be appropriately regulated.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />JTI also believes in the freedom of adults to choose whether they want to smoke and that no one should smoke unless he or she understands the risks of doing so. These risks distinguish tobacco from most consumer goods and they place upon the industry a real responsibility. It's a responsibility for which JTI expects to be held accountable, together with governments and the rest of society.","acronym":"JTI","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Customs, Economic and Financial Affairs, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Home Affairs, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"• Directive 2014/40/EU: of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products and repealing Directive 2001/37/EC&#xd;<br />• Directive 2011/64/EC on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco (codification) and Directive 2008/118/EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC.&#xd;<br />• The Trademark Directive (2008/95/EC) and the Community Trademark Regulation (207/2009/EC). &#xd;<br />• Better Regulation&#xd;<br />• International FTAs&#xd;<br />• Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste&#xd;<br />• Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste","lastUp":"2018-03-15T12:58:38.926+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1250000-1499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
