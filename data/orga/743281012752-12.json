As part of our charitable remit to encourage the spread of free and open online educational content, we support and promote (but do not write, control or run) the wide range of Wikimedia projects, including the Wikipedia website. We act as the UK national chapter for the worldwide Wikimedia open content movement. As a UK charity we have our own independent board of trustees and staff team. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Wikimedia UK believes that open access to knowledge is a fundamental right, and a driver for social and economic development. Our mission is to support and advocate for the development of open knowledge, working in partnership with volunteers, the cultural and education sectors and other organisations to make knowledge available, usable and reusable online. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We currently have three key programme strands, which are directly aligned with our strategic goals:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Diverse content and contributors&#xd;<br />Promoting open knowledge&#xd;<br />Education and learning&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2016 Wikimedia UK trained 900 new Wikipedia editors, worked with 4000 individuals, and supported the creation or improvement of nearly half a million articles on the Wikimedia projects. Volunteers are hugely important to the delivery of our charitable objects and contributed a total of 20,000 hours to our projects and programmes last year.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Wikimedia UK works closely with other European chapters of the Wikimedia movement, and with the Wikimedia Foundation in the United States.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our main area of engagement with the European Commission in 2017 is to advocate for changes to the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on copyright in the Digital Single Market.","acronym":"WMUK","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Communication, Culture, Education, Information Society, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"As noted above, our current main area of engagement with the European Commission is to advocate for changes to the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on copyright in the Digital Single Market.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are working with other Wikimedia Chapters and partners to include three positive changes in the reform, each of which will make more content available on our projects. These are Freedom of Panorama, a ‘Public Domain Safeguard’) and a fix to the Database Directive (‘protection upon registration’).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our ancillary goals are to fix the ‘text and data mining’ exception to cover all users and not only ‘research organisations’ as it is now; to remove or heavily weaken Article 11, which would require user-generated content projects to monitor content uploaded by users; and to voice the potential risks of the proposed Press Publishers' Right.","lastUp":"2017-03-22T14:38:46.525+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
