Tesla designs, manufactures and markets all-electric vehicles (EVs) together with solutions for renewable energy production and storage. We want to be a catalyst for larger and broader investments in clean energy options.&#xd;<br />All Tesla vehicles have a range sufficient to completely replace combustion vehicles. Each generation of Tesla vehicles is one step further towards democratising EVs as a genuine alternative to combustion vehicles – for short as well as long distance travelling. We starting with a high-end sport car (Roadster, cumulative global sales 2,500). In 2017 we delivered over 100,000 of our second generation of premium family vehicles (Model S and Model X) and started delivering our third, mass-market ‘Model 3’. Early spring 2018, we produced 4,000 vehicles per week, and the global Tesla fleet had covered over 10 billion electric kilometres and saved 3MT of CO2.&#xd;<br />The unveiling of Tesla Semi, a full-size heavy truck in November 2017 launched Tesla into a new product category that will have a transformative impact due to a total cost of ownership that is superior to diesel trucks. Tesla Semi combines a real-world range of up to 800km and has been designed to dramatically improve safety not only for the driver and cargo, but also for pedestrians and other cars on the road.&#xd;<br />Tesla is investing heavily in recharging infrastructure to create a no-compromise EV experience. Tesla’s pan-European motorway-charging network (“Supercharger Network”) enables EV customers to travel across Europe using only renewably sourced electricity. At the end of 2017, we operated 1,128 supercharger locations worldwide of which almost 400 in Europe. Through our “Destination Charging” program, started in 2016, we are also supporting the larger tourism industry (hotels, restaurants, touristic resorts, etc.) in providing charging solutions for all EV users.&#xd;<br />To support the development of renewably produced electricity, Tesla launched small and large-scale stationary battery storage solutions in 2015. For individual owners, Tesla’s “Powerwall” solution enables self-consumption of locally produced electricity or deferred electricity consumption to off-peak hours, as well as ensures continuation of supply in the event of a power failure. For industrial customers, Tesla’s “Powerpack” solution enables larger storage projects and grid services applications. On December 1, 2017, we completed installation of the largest battery in the world ahead of schedule in South Australia and we are planning to open the largest European battery in Belgium in May 2018.&#xd;<br />We started delivering our own ‘solar roof’ solution to enable individual electricity consumers to locally produce their own renewable electricity. Tesla’s solution is different from traditional solar panels: our solar tiles hide a photovoltaic cell within a true imitation of traditional roof tiles. &#xd;<br />With these three essential components – solar power generation, electricity storage and electric mobility – Tesla seeks to genuinely accelerate the global transition towards a sustainable energy regime. &#xd;<br />Tesla is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, USA, and currently employs 37,000 people worldwide. Tesla’s main productions capacities are currently located in Fremont, California, Reno, Nevada and Buffalo, New York. In 2017 global revenue amounted $11.8bn, €9.7bn at April 2018 exchange rate.&#xd;<br />Our European footprint is growing quickly. We operate an assembly facility in Tilburg, the Netherlands, and Tesla Grohmann Automation in Prüm, Germany, develops technologies to advance our production. Tesla´s European Headquarter is located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We have around 4,500 employees across Europe and around 100 sales and service centres.","acronym":"Tesla","interests":"Climate Action, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Customs, Development, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, Information Society, Internal Market, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Tesla follows EU policy initiatives in the following areas: climate and energy policy, transport, automotive policies, industrial policy, waste and cyclical economy, data and digital society.","lastUp":"2018-04-06T11:28:48.955+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
