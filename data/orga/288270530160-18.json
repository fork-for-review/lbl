In a hyperloop system, pressurized passenger and cargo vehicles travel in a low-pressure tube environment, driven by linear induction motors at speeds exceeding 1000 km/h. TransPod’s cutting-edge new design enables a significant reduction in the investment capital, increases the system’s reliability, and improves its operational performance, allowing a stronger business case than what has been developed for this system so far. TransPod’s vehicle and infrastructure are being designed together for optimal performance, using TransPod’s IP. Powered by environmentally-sustainable solar/electric energy in a tube system that is unaffected by weather conditions, TransPod’s system enables passenger and cargo travel that is faster than airline travel, creating a reliable mass transportation system and a high-potential investment opportunity for infrastructure investors.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Current modes of transport such as cars, trucks, trains and aircrafts are slow, expensive, fossil-fuel dependent, polluting, and vulnerable to weather conditions. TransPod’s system provides an attractive choice for consumers in terms of speed, convenience and price (compared to airline tickets and high-speed rail tickets), in order to achieve significant government policy objectives: reducing highway congestion and maintenance, reducing carbon emissions, being fully-electric and fossil-fuel-free, and increasing economic activity through rapid intercity commerce.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Commuters and businesses alike will benefit from a low-priced, frequent, and high-speed transportation service without the need for fossil fuels.&#xd;<br />TransPod’s technology is designed for global impact, in terms of business case and climate benefits, designed for adaptable deployment and customization for different cities, station configurations, and public/private infrastructure consortium partners worldwide.","acronym":"","interests":"Climate Action, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"TransPod is involved with the following EU initiative/program:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Eureka: a European network developing cooperation between SMEs, research centres and universities for industrial innovation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The European regional development fund.","lastUp":"2018-02-12T21:42:57.801+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
