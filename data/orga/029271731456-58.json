The program strengthens the involvement of citizens themselves and patient associations in deciding on key health services, directly promotes patient rights protection and establishes long-term solutions that contribute to the improvement and preservation of health.&#xd;<br />Therefore, the program envisages activities to promote the national plan and the preparation of proposals, and the expected result is the recognition and adoption of the national plan at the institutional level.","lastUp":"2018-05-05T15:47:49.375+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
