All information and guidance is free of charge. The guidance is primarily for consumers or for someone representing consumers. The consumers can turn to the Consumer Bureau in questions concerning the electricity- or gas market. If the consumer has a problem or a dispute with a supplier or distributor, our advice is that the consumer primarily should contact the company concerned. The Bureau informs the consumers about legislation and other regulations, and how they are applied by the suppliers and the distributors. The Bureau provides statistics based on the problems that the consumers have.","acronym":"","interests":"Consumer Affairs, Energy","euInitiatives":"Energy Winter package specifically and Consumer issues in general","lastUp":"2017-12-20T11:13:14.666+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
