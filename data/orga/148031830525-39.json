FOGGS is a Public Benefit Foundation under Belgian law and is governed by its statutes.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The FOGGS founders were inspired by the work of the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability (2010-2012), which, among other things, was instrumental in introducing the concept of Sustainable Development Goals. The initial aspiration was for FOGGS to continue the Panel’s work, including in the area of the economy, which had proven particularly sensitive for the Panel to tackle.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since December 2017, FOGGS has been relaunched with new ambition and primary focus on putting together a positive and sustainable “Grand Narrative” for the era of globalisation that we are living in.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Grand Narrative is a story that brings together humankind and reconciles it with the planet we live on. It is a means to re-tool personal, business and political choices and apply in practice an innovative and sustainable economy geared towards well-being, a society that respects diversity, a natural environment that is at balance and systems of governance that are transparent, inclusive and work for all.","acronym":"FOGGS","interests":"Climate Action, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"EU External Action, EU at the United Nations, EU Development Cooperation, EU and SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) implementation, EU and the Paris Agreement / EU Climate and Energy Targets","lastUp":"2018-03-15T11:35:50.857+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
