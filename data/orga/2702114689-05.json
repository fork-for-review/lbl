OFE's role has since evolved and its primary role now is to promote the use of open standards in ICT as a means of achieving full openness and interoperability of computer systems throughout Europe. It continues to promote open source software, as well as openness more generally as part of a vision to facilitate open, competitive choice for IT users. In support of this vision, it develops the thinking in five main policy areas: standardisation, public procurement, cloud computing, intellectual property and cybersecurity.","acronym":"OpenForum Europe","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Communication, Competition, Enterprise, Information Society, Internal Market, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"The following is a non-exclusive list of the main topics followed by OFE in 2017:&#xd;<br />- Cybersecurity Act;&#xd;<br />- Digital Single Market Strategy;&#xd;<br />- European Cloud Computing Strategy ;&#xd;<br />- European Multi Stakeholder Platform on ICT Standardisation ;&#xd;<br />- ISA2;&#xd;<br />- EIF;&#xd;<br />- Review of the EU copyright rules ;&#xd;<br />- Digital Agenda Action 23: Provide guidance on ICT standardisation and public procurement ;&#xd;<br />- Revision of public procurement directive 2004/17/EC.&#xd;<br />- GDPR;&#xd;<br />- NIS and the NIS Platform;","lastUp":"2018-03-26T16:26:37.997+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
