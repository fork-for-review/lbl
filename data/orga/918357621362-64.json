We do this through: (i) workshops, (ii) round tables, (iii) research, (iv) networking space, (v) internet platform and (vi) conferences (including annually organizing New Education Forum).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our activities are dedicated to schools (especially teachers as mentors), employers, decision makers and institutions engaged in education projects from around the World.&#xd;<br />Center for Innovative Education supports implementing global education and learning of soft skills like cooperation and communication capabilities, self-organization and responsibility for the teamwork at early stages of learning. Through such training young people are more aware of their social roles and are better prepared for entering the labor market and constitute preferable future employees. Taking to the account European Union’s high rate of youth unemployment this issue constitutes a crucial task to address. We strongly believe that solution to this problem lies with restructuring of education, which can be done through dedicated teachers and outside support of business and non-governmental organizations.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Innovative approach of the Center derives from six years experience of collaboration with over 3.500 schools around Poland and abroad and patented education programs involving entrepreneurs and non-governmental organizations, which result in improving effectiveness of learning (i.e. teacher oriented “MENTOR” programs and students oriented  “TALENT” programs).","acronym":"CIE","interests":"Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Youth","euInitiatives":"Improving Vocational Learning system across member states&#xd;<br />Counteracting youth unemployment&#xd;<br />Reforming formal education&#xd;<br />Encouraging business and non governmental organizations to participate in the education process","lastUp":"2018-04-07T21:04:48.453+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
