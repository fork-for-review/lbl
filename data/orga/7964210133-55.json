In 2008 it was registered in Belgium as a non-profit association with a Board of 11 international Directors. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We aim to help make European tourism destinations, products and services accessible to all. We bring together all actors and stakeholders in the tourism sector – private, public and NGOs – to share experiences, learn from each other and collaborate in joint projects and partnerships.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We support tourism enterprises and public organisations by encouraging the development and spread of good policies and practices. We raise awareness, carry out research and provide expertise on accessibility issues for the tourism sector.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are a platform for all those who support accessibility in tourism, and a strong representative voice in Europe towards national institutions and organisations whose actions have a direct influence on the tourism sector.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ENAT has National Contact Points in most of the EU Member States. ENAT started as a European Network, but we now have members from many countries around the world sharing in our activities and collaborating with our European members. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2011 ENAT signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the UN World Tourism Organisation and the Spanish Fundación ONCE to develop projects and initiaves which support accessible tourism worldwide. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We have our sights clearly set on the path ahead and on the ultimate destination: accessible tourism for all.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Further information is available at: www.accessibletourism.org","acronym":"ENAT","interests":"Consumer Affairs, Culture, Development, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, Information Society, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Sport, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Sustainable Growth, Tourism, Competition, SMEs, Employment, Justice, Equal Rights, Health, ICT, Research and Technology, Maritime, Transport, European Communication Networks, Regional Development, Urban development, Cohesion, Europe Aid, Education and Training, Heritage, Culture, Arts, Creative Europe, Third Sector activities.","lastUp":"2017-03-09T20:08:56.801+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
