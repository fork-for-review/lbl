Together we act to improve the life chances of vulnerable young people by: promoting their personal and professional development in society; supporting their active citizenship initiatives; and by developing inclusive youth policy at local, regional and national levels across Europe. In fostering transnational activities, we are a European forum for sharing good practice in youth and social work, and for giving voice to young people’s ideas. &#xd;<br />To meet these goals, the YES Forum: &#xd;<br />•\torganises transnational activities with and for vulnerable young  people with focus on learning mobility and employment; &#xd;<br />•\tdevelops and promotes innovative approaches in youth and social work in trainings, seminars and conferences;&#xd;<br />•\tcontributes to policy on youth and social affairs by transferring experience from concrete practice and young people’s input.","acronym":"YES Forum","interests":"Employment and Social Affairs, Youth","euInitiatives":"The social and economic developments in the past six years have shown, young people are the ones facing the worst economic outlook. Now more than ever it is of utmost importance to achieve significant change for young people in the EU under the ambitious agenda set forth by the Europe 2020 Strategy and the EU Youth Strategy: smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth through concrete and effective actions to increase equal opportunities for young people in education and in the job market as well as to them in active, democratic participation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The YES Forum is a European network which works diligently to support these objectives, and it constantly works towards finding new and innovative ways to work with and for young people. But we believe that they can only be reached through strong youth and social work sector across Europe, and with a civil society that devotes special attention to youth empowerment and personal, educational and professional development as much as to increasing employability and development of quality youth policy. Our members specialise in providing not only attractive and distinctive activities, but also opportunities for creative expression of young people’s voices and paths into employment. We are dedicated to developing flexible learning and to providing opportunities for youth exchanges, apprenticeships, volunteering and training that prepare young people for employment.","lastUp":"2018-03-15T09:46:30.271+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
