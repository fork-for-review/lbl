In Europe more than 1,5 million LOVE condoms are distributed annually in our countries of operation to key affected populations such as MSM (men having sex with men), sex workers, youth, migrants and PUDs (people using drugs).  On 13th of February, during International Condom Day, AHF instigates a major condom push by organizing events throughout Europe to celebrate condom use and to create sexual health awareness.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Rapid Testing and linkage services &#xd;<br />AHF Europe runs community initiated rapid testing services that target key affected populations as well as general population: in the programme in The Netherlands, Portugal and Greece, rapid testing is performed by non-medical staff in a peer driven environment. AHF Europe runs AHFCheckpoint.nl in Amsterdam, and partners in 2 Checkpoints in Greece (Athens and Thessaloniki) and CheckpointLX Lisbon and InMouraria in Portugal. In these walk in clinics anyone can come by for a test and the testing and counseling services are always confidential and free of charge. These testing services target most at risk populations, and have a high uptake of people that get tested for the first time. In Lithuania and Estonia rapid tests are performed by medical professionals in collaboration with partner organizations and healthcare facilities, targeting youth, MSM, prisoners and PUDs. In 2016, 50390 people received a rapid HIV test, with 1,57% seroprevalence and 75% linkage to care rate. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Treatment services &#xd;<br />AHF Europe runs the first and only community-led HIV Clinic in Europe in Narva, Estonia.

The Linda Clinic also has an offsite testing program; rapid testing is performed in shelters, night clubs, public places and shopping malls.","acronym":"AHF","interests":"Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Youth","euInitiatives":"-Action Plan on HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighboring countries: 2014-2016  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-ECDC Guidance: HIV testing: increasing uptake and effectiveness in the European Union (2010)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-Health for Growth programme: the third multi-annual programme of EU action in the field of health for the period 2014-2020  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-OptTest project: Optimising testing and linkage to care for HIV across Europe &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-European Parliament working group on innovation, access to medicines and poverty related diseases. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-EU HIV Civil Society Forum and Think Tank &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-European HIV and HepC testing week&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-European neighborhood policy &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-EACS - The European Guidelines for treatment of HIV-positive adults in Europe.
