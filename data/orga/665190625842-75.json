With a current number of 60,464 patients in care in Russia (30 340), Ukraine (29 767) and Estonia (357) and a total of 252, 934 people tested (2013-2017) across Europe, AHF Europe is the largest implementer of its kind in Europe. In addition, AHF partners in Russia and Ukraine tested a total of 757, 962 people between 2013 and 2017. AHF believes in and works towards a user driven model of prevention, treatment and care. Current countries of operation are Russia, Ukraine, The Netherlands and Estonia. In Portugal, Greece and Lithuania AHF Europe partners with GAT Portugal, Positive Voice and Demetra, respectively. AHF Europe works with both government and non-government organisations. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Prevention services&#xd;<br />AHF distributes its own condoms, LOVE condoms, throughout the world. In Europe more than 1.5 million LOVE condoms are distributed annually in our countries of operation to key affected populations such as MSM (men having sex with men), sex workers, youth, migrants and IDUs (injecting drug users).  On the 13th of February, during International Condom Day, AHF instigates a major condom push by organizing events throughout Europe to celebrate condom use and to create sexual health awareness.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Rapid Testing and linkage services &#xd;<br />AHF Europe runs community initiated rapid testing services that target key affected populations as well as general population: in the programme in The Netherlands, Portugal and Greece, rapid testing is performed by non-medical staff in a peer driven environment. AHF Europe runs AHF Checkpoint Amsterdam (from 2012) and AHF Checkpoint Kyiv (from 2016). Additionally, AHF partners operate 2 Checkpoints in Greece (Athens and Thessaloniki) and CheckpointLX Lisbon and InMouraria in Portugal. In these walk in clinics anyone can come for a test; the testing and counselling services are always confidential and free of charge. These testing services target most at risk populations, and have a high uptake of people that get tested for the first time. In Lithuania and Estonia rapid tests are performed by medical professionals in collaboration with partner organizations and healthcare facilities, targeting youth, MSM, prisoners and PUDs. In 2017, 54,815 people received a rapid HIV test, with 1% sero prevalence and 84.8% linkage to care rate. &#xd;<br />In 2017, an MoU was signed with the city of Athens to implement a joint testing program offering support to vulnerable groups such as migrants, women, homeless people and IDUs. The testing program will start on March 1st 2018.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Treatment services &#xd;<br />AHF Europe operates the Linda Clinic in Narva, Estonia, utilising a unique person centred approach. The country suffers the highest HIV rates in the EU and in the region of Narva only a small percentage of people living with HIV have access to ARVS. The Linda Clinic currently has 357 registered patients, with 90% treatment coverage. The Linda Clinic also has an offsite testing program; rapid testing is performed in shelters, night clubs, public places and shopping malls. In 2017, Linda Clinic commenced the service provision of a infectious disease doctor in Viru Prison, with visits twice a month. &#xd;<br />AHF’s clinical program in Ukraine and Russia are implemented in partnership with healthcare facilities, including AIDS centres and HIV testing and care sites. The model focuses on integrated care, for example with TB or OST services, decentralisation of services and person centred care.","acronym":"AHF","interests":"Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Youth","euInitiatives":"•White paper on the Future of Europe&#xd;<br />•ECDC Guidance: HIV testing: increasing uptake and effectiveness in the European Union (2010)-Health for Growth programme: the third multi-annual programme of EU action in the field of health for the period 2014-2020  &#xd;<br />•OptTest project: Optimising testing and linkage to care for HIV across Europe &#xd;<br />•European Parliament working group on innovation, access to medicines and poverty related diseases. &#xd;<br />•EU HIV Civil Society Forum and Think Tank &#xd;<br />•European HIV and HepC testing week&#xd;<br />•European neighbourhood policy &#xd;<br />•EACS - The European Guidelines for treatment of HIV-positive adults in Europe.
