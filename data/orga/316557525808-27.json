Our main activity is the production and distribution of fertilizers, combined with extension service and knowledge transfer to our end clients – the farmers – to get better added value for their crops while using our products in a sustainable manner. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Azomures became a member of Ameropa Group in 2012. To increase production capacity and, at the same time, reduce the impact on the environment, we in the summer of 2012 started the implementation of an investment plan to modernize the plant.
