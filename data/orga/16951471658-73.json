The provision reads:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1.\tThe Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, set up in accordance with the framework existing prior to this Act coming into force, will be made up of savings banks, banking foundations, and credit institutions, to form a whole and maintain the functions and aims they hold in accordance with the aforementioned framework and any others outlined in their statutes.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2.\tThe Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks will lose its status as a credit institution when the statutes mentioned in the previous section are brought into force, without prejudice to its ability to offer services through any other participating bank, in the terms established by its statutes.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CECA adopts as a fundamental principle and standard of conduct the preservation of the character and independence of its members.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />At CECA we work on the dissemination and promotion of a retail banking model, prioritizing financing to families and SMEs.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CECA structures its activity around four core areas: Institutional representation, Economic and Regulatory analysis, Social Investment and Worker Representation. Its main tasks are: &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-Representation and defense of interests of its members within the Spanish and international financial system, and maintaining dialogue with the various regulatory and supervisory authorities, both national and international; &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-CECA compiles and analyses financial data on sector associated companies and the financial system as a whole. It is also tasked with publishing its members' public financial statements. CECA also has regulatory analysis specialists who monitor salient points on  both the national and international agenda.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-CECA is responsible for disseminating and promoting the Social Investment (both Social Work and Corporate Social Responsibility).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tAnd finally, after signing the Collective Agreement of Savings Banks and Financial  Institutions for 2015-2018 on 30 June 2016, CECA took over the ACARL  (Savings Banks' Association for Labour Relations), which is why CECA is  currently overseeing all the companies linked to the Collective Agreement for  savings banks and financial institutions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The 11 financial institutions represented by CECA account for (data December 2017): &#xd;<br />• Total assets of 800,136 EUR Mill.&#xd;<br />• 33% of the sector in total assets. &#xd;<br />• 38% of the Spanish financial system in terms of deposits. &#xd;<br />• 12,891 branches in Spain (45% of Spanish Financial System)&#xd;<br />• Workforce of 74,742 employees (39% of Spanish Financial System)","acronym":"CECA","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Budget, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture,
