ETN addresses the main challenges and concerns of the GT users in technical committees and project groups, composed of experts from the whole value chain, including the power generation and the oil &amp; gas industry, the manufacturers of gas turbines (OEMs), the R&amp;D community (universities and research institutes), suppliers and technical service providers, technology consultancies and industry associations. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The objective of ETN is to strengthen the gas turbine industry and users' market globally in all its facets. Through cooperative efforts and by optimising GT Research and Technology Development (RTD), the association promotes environmentally sound GT technology with reliable and low cost operation. Besides facilitating and coordinating research effort of different parties and bringing together key stakeholders in the gas turbine community, ETN also presents extensive networking opportunities and acts as solid platform for the exchange of knowledge and experiences. ETN performs technology watch, identifies research gaps and influences the EU research agenda and policy-making at an early stage. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Collaboration across the whole value chain creates a powerful network with the ability to achieve tangible advances in gas turbine technology. A common strategy and research effort between the stakeholders, along with a supportive European Union policy, will enable the expansion and increased competitiveness of the gas turbine sector in Europe. The ETN Secretariat is located in Brussels, Belgium, at heart of the European decision-making process.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ETN was part of the OMSoP project (www.omsop.eu) which was co-funded by the European Commission, Directorate-General for Energy, under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for Research and Technological Development.","acronym":"ETN","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"ETN mainly follows the future common energy policy developments (2020, 2030 and 2050 goals), climate change policy, environment policy, research policy, in particular the industrial emissions, energy efficiency,  Horizon 2020 research funding framework, EU emissions trading and carbon capture and storage dossiers.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ETN attends the ITRE and ENVI Committee meetings in the European Parliament, and the conferences organised by the European Commission on energy, research, climate change and environmental initiatives and policy.","lastUp":"2018-02-15T12:49:52.396+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
