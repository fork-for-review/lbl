NPLD includes Governments both national and regional, Universities and Associations as its members.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />NPLD’s main goal is to raise awareness at a European level on the vital importance of linguistic diversity. NPLD also aims to facilitate the exchange of best practices among governments, policy makers, practitioners, researchers and experts from all over Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The following points set out NPLD's core objectives and key principles.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />It will exchange best practice and counselling in language usage and development and experience regarding policy making on linguistic diversity at all levels of governance; promote understanding, collaboration and partnerships in linguistic diversity; and seek greater international recognition of the importance of the contributions made by the members and associate members to promote linguistic diversity.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In line with the same notion, it will represent the voice of its autochthonous language communities that have their language regeneration effort undermined or blocked by their host state or states. It will take place at the national/regional, member state and EU level under the supervision and guidance of the respective governments that make up the Steering Committee of the NPLD.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />It aims to directly provide input to and influence the EU Council, the decision making body of the EU. It will contribute collectively to consultations conducted by the EU on matters relating to language policy and linguistic diversity and provide written submission as and when required.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />It will monitor all forthcoming funding mechanisms and proposed legislation of relevance to the development of regional and minority languages.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />It will seek to act in an advisory capacity to EU institutions, NGOs, member states and autonomous governments on all aspects of language policy, language promotion and regeneration.&#xd;<br />   &#xd;<br />Following the EU principle of solidarity, it will as far as is reasonably possible, and in line with its own members policy objectives, exert political influence on behalf of CRSS and regional and minority languages in order to secure linguistic equality for its members’ languages, the meaningful respect for linguistic diversity and to ensure that its members’ languages have the best possible conditions to flourish in. In order to develop meaningful linguistic diversity it will represent all CRSS and regional and minority languages, with a special regard for those that are endangered or that face conditions that may endanger or hinder language development.&#xd;<br />   &#xd;<br />It will apply for funding on behalf of CRSS and regional and minority language development at the EU and member state level.","acronym":"NPLD","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Communication, Culture, Education, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"All issues relating to the promotion of CRSS* languages in Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />*Constitutional regional and smaller state languages","lastUp":"2018-03-07T10:33:41.314+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
