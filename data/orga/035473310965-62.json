This has been its key objective since its founding in 1996.&#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe values supported by AEIP are based on a balanced representation of employers and employees which is a typical feature of joint management (as well as social policy emanating from collective bargaining), solidarity and transparency; this approach is complementary to that applied within the social economy.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nUltimately, its aim is the recognition of the status of the European Paritarian Institution of Social Protection, as a structure enabling joint negotiations and joint management of cross-border collective agreements on pensions, health and providence schemes.&#xd;\n &#xd;\nAEIP also promotes studies and dissemination of paritarism in the field of social protection through conferences, seminars and publications and representation at EU-level through close contacts and cooperation with the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.","memberOrga":"http://www.tela.fi/tietoa_telasta/jasenet","goal":"The Finnish Pension Alliance TELA represents all pension alliances operating in Finland.
