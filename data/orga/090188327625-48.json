The objective is to facilitate access into the labour market for people who fled conflict and persecution. We aim to promote participation in socio-economic and cultural life. We also want to raise awareness of Syrian culture and traditions. &#xd;<br />The main activities of \"We Exist\" are: &#xd;<br />• Organisation of cultural and culinary events&#xd;<br />• Awareness raising events.&#xd;<br />Thanks to these convivial and artistic activities we wish to make our citizens aware of the challenges within our society and the richness of our diversities. These activities will also enable our NGO to raise funds and to start recruiting people who fled conflict and persecution. With the development of activities and the increase of financial resources, the long-term objective is to multiply the recruitment of people who fled conflict and persecution.&#xd;<br />We also want to raise the awareness of problems people coming from war and persecution face on daily basis.","acronym":"","interests":"Culture, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, External Relations, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Youth","euInitiatives":"We established our organisation in September 2016 and we had several fundraising events.

We are currently discussing events at the European Parliament with some Committees.&#xd;<br />Our plan for the future is to be actively involved in discussion on policy and legislative files. We believe that, when discussing the issues, people who are concerned, should take an active part in it.","lastUp":"2018-06-05T22:48:35.821+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
