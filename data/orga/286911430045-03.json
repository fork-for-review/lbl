We deal with future technologies, as well as globalization and the resulting changes for our society. Especially for our generation, there will be a structural change that will affect all areas of our lives. &#xd;<br />In our association work we analyze future technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics or blockchain. We prepare these topics for young people in order to give everyone the opportunity to inform and educate in a simple way.&#xd;<br />Furthermore, we support the exchange of young people among each other. We participate in various events and conferences to provide public relation work, for example this summer at the European Youth Event in Strasbourg hosted by the European Commission with over 8,000 young people from all over Europe.","acronym":"JBS","interests":"Communication, Competition, Development, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Enterprise, External Relations, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Information Society, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"All topics relating to, and impacting, young people.
