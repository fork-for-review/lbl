In particular, we have a keen interest in the current ETS III as well as fossil CO2 emission reduction targets. We are also very interested in proposals on the use of renewable energy. &#xd;<br />We believe that European policies regarding climate change should not be tightened in the absence of international agreements. We therefore recommend that the EU gives greater priority to improving the overall competitive situation of industry in Europe towards which lowering energy prices forms an important step.","lastUp":"2017-04-11T12:11:14.178+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
