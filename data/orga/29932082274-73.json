INTUG has an active dialogue with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the International Institute of Communications (IIC), the European Competitive Telecommunications Association (ECTA), the European Telecommunications Network Operators (ETNO), the GSM Association (GSMA), the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) and the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO).","memberOrga":"Members and Correspondents include BELTUG (Belgium), BTG (Netherlands), Afutt (France), Dansk IT (Denmark), ASUT (Switzerland), TUANZ (New Zealand), ACCAN (Australia), BCS/CMA (UK), AUTELSI (Spain), Telecom eV (Germany), IDTUG (Indonesia), ASUCOM (Colombia), RECATIC (Africa), CTO (Commonwealth) and other contacts.","goal":"INTUG is a global independent not-for-profit organisation linking business users, user groups and contacts, each representing small, medium and large enterprise business users of telecommunications services in the private and public sectors.  It has links with suppliers, regulators and government representatives.  INTUG aims to ensure the needs of business users are understood, wherever communications networks and services are discussed and decisions made affecting business users.  This requires analysis of the national and international business markets in terms of competitiveness, separately from the mass consumer retail market.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />INTUG has permanent observer status at ITU, expert group status at OECD, and represents users at the European Parliament/Commission, BEREC, APECTEL.  INTUG works with the Institute of International Communications (IIC), ETNO, ECTA, the GSM Association and the Commuter and Communications Industry Association (CCIA).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />INTUG believes ICT should operate on the basis of open standards for interoperability at all layers of  communications, including applications, data content, networks and devices.  This stimulates investment and innovation in new developments, functions, processes, applications and networks.  This should be reflected in service based competition supported by infrastructure sharing, especially for access.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />This leads to more efficient business processes within government and the public sector, within and between private enterprises, and in links to end users.  This generates economic growth and jobs and facilitates more take-up of efficient e-government.  It broadens scope, scale and choice in public procurement, and maintains and extends a competitive market, where there is potential for new players to break into what can otherwise be a closed domain for a small list of \"approved\" government suppliers, linked to large enterprise customers similarly constrained by lock-in to their historical incumbent suppliers.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />All these arguments apply not just at national level, but even more so at EU level, where the principles of a single market can open opportunities for more vigorous competition, greater economies of scale and flexibility to change to better suppliers, again in public to public, public to private and private to private applications, in a transborder context of connectivity, which is not confined to national standards of usage and choice.  The key word in all this is interoperability, and that objective can best be achieved and sustained by non-proprietary standards, but within a context that recognises the risk/reward need to encourage investment and innovation.  The aim must be to use ICT as an EU-wide economic enabler.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />INTUG's goal is to ensure that communications services are fully used to enable economic growth, job creation, and secure access to the information and services needed to participate in society for all organisations and individual citizens, especially in public and private cloud applications and in the growing Internet of Things with Machine to Machine applications which know no borders.","acronym":"INTUG","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Communication, Competition, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Enterprise, Information Society, Internal Market, Taxation, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Elimination of International Roaming Charges.&#xd;<br />Seamless International Mobile services.&#xd;<br />Consistent Network Neutrality regulation globally which allows differentiation in quality of service without discrimination.&#xd;<br />Security of access, data and software in the cloud environment.&#xd;<br />Open access to bottleneck resources, such as last mile connectivity.&#xd;<br />Harmonisation of spectrum allocation processes and outcomes.&#xd;<br />Cloud Service Quality.&#xd;<br />Software vendor Code of Conduct.","lastUp":"2017-03-01T10:03:54.959+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
