It stands for diversity and social fairness in Higher Education (HE) and aims to accelerate the modernisation of the European Higher Education Area. The network deploys intensive cooperation and policy experimentation under five key pillars: (1) Digital Higher Education both for governance and provision of education, (2) Entrepreneurship and employability skills of graduates, (3) Policy innovation at national and European level, (4) Active citizenship of students and (5) Quality mobility for all. The network's key activities are designed to build capacity and expertise among administrative and academic staff members, to raise awareness of EU policy goals and actions and to enable policy dialogs between practitioners, policy-makers and stakeholders. The activities are underpinned by the organisation of high quality student mobility, since this is considered to be an excellent driver to implement reforms within HE.","acronym":"EUF","interests":"Culture, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, General and Institutional Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"Erasmus+, Europe for Citizens, and Education and Training 2020, Digital Single Market","lastUp":"2018-02-14T14:50:08.461+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
