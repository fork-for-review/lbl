Circle Economy is a cooperative, and together with our members and partners we create industrial systems that are restorative by design by decoupling growth and resource needs.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We accelerate the transition towards a circular economy by providing insights in what a circular future might look like for a company, a region or even worldwide, and by coming up with scenarios for how to get there. Moreover, we provide a powerful network, tools and experience to the members of our cooperative to turn these scenarios into reality.","acronym":"Circle Economy","interests":"Climate Action, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Energy, Environment, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Participation in the project: Interreg NWE - Fibersort","lastUp":"2018-01-03T09:32:08.282+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
