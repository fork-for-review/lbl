To do this, we identify projects with especially strong potential to bring about social change. We start with a quality assessment process that we developed with experts in the field, identifying sectors to focus on and closely scrutinizing relevant non-profit organisations and their projects. When we find an approach that we feel is especially promising, we award it with the PHINEO impact-label.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As a not-for-profit corporation, PHINEO is supported by a broad alliance of business and civil society organisations. Together, we strengthen the non-profit sector.","acronym":"","interests":"Climate Action, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Development, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Public Health, Regional Policy, Sport, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"support of civic engagement for the purpose of common welfare","lastUp":"2018-01-18T15:10:26.115+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
