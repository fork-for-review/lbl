The MVNO has strengthened its position by offering a wide range of integrated innovative services and being a major investor and job creator in the market. Present on both the consumer and the business segments, PosteMobile is a proximity enterprise operating through the country’s 14.000 post offices. PosteMobile provides innovative offers associating telecommunications with financial services, with the possibility to link the SIM card with a Banco Posta’s means of payment or credit card. PosteMobile is therefore Italy’s biggest MVNO, with more than 50% market share, while being the leading Italian operator in remote financial services, with one million customers using the service and more than 250 million euro of annual payments made through the SIM card. PosteMobile was honoured at the 2013 “MVNO Industry Awards”, organised by Informa Telecoms and Media, as the “most innovative MVNO” and “most successful MVNO”.","acronym":"","interests":"Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Information Society, Internal Market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"The Telecom Single Market &#xd;<br />The review of the telecom regulatory framework","lastUp":"2018-01-31T10:00:19.560+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
