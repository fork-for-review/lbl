As a non-governmental, politically independent, and non-profit organisation AEGEE is open to students and young people from all faculties and disciplines. Founded in 1985 in Paris, today AEGEE has grown to a Network of 13000 friends, present in 200 cities in 40 countries all over Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AEGEE puts the idea of a unified Europe into practice. Operating without a national level, AEGEE brings 13000 students from 40 different countries directly in touch with each other.&#xd;<br />Vision&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AEGEE strives for a democratic, diverse and borderless Europe, which is socially, economically and politically integrated, and values the participation of young people in its construction and development.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Mission&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AEGEE empowers students and young people in Europe to take an active role in society. It creates a space for dialogue and learning opportunities as well as acts as their representative towards decision-makers. Moreover, AEGEE strengthens mutual understanding and brings Europe closer to young people.&#xd;<br />Means&#xd;<br />Intercultural Exchange&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AEGEE creates a space for members of different backgrounds to meet and learn about cultural differences, in order to foster mutual understanding. AEGEE supports mobility and encourages young people to cross borders and make new friends, to break stereotypes and strengthen tolerance, respect and solidarity.&#xd;<br />Personal Development and Non Formal Education&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AEGEE provides learning opportunities for the development of its members through non-formal education and informal learning. By participating in trainings courses, workshops, and active involvement in the organisation, our members improve their competences (such as leadership skills, communication skills and team management) which will be useful for their future lives.&#xd;<br />Thematic Projects&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Thematic projects, either local or international, are initiatives developed by members of AEGEE. They deal with current challenges in the European society, create awareness among young people and propose solutions from a student point of view. The outcome of this work has an impact in- and outside of AEGEE.&#xd;<br />Advocacy and Policy&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AEGEE gathers the opinions of European students and represents them towards  stakeholders through campaigns, lobby actions, conferences and membership in bigger advocacy platforms. In addition, AEGEE informs students and young people about the impact which European policies have in their lives and opportunities they offer&#xd;<br />Forum for Discussion&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AEGEE provides a space for young Europeans to discuss and exchange different points of view with a European perspective,in order to find a common ground. This exchange of ideas happens in all our activities but a special place for them is our Working groups, conferences and General Assemblies (EBM &amp; Agora).","acronym":"AEGEE","interests":"Climate Action, Culture, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, Environment, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Regional Policy, Sport, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"We, the members of AEGEE, young Europeans coming from all regions of the continent, recognise that we are the future and present of our society and that our contribution to the construction of Europe is our responsibility. We come together under a common vision of a democratic, diverse and borderless Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We come together in AEGEE to form an open, voluntary network where we transform our ideas into actions, develop ourselves to participate actively in society, and contribute to the European debate with our independent student’s perspective.&#xd;<br />We hereby declare these principles to be fundamental to us:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The diversity of Europe has to be valued,and we reflect it in our organisation. The richness of our continent relies on people from different cultures and backgrounds coming together and being united by common values.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Cooperation between people and communities begins with dialogue and mutual understanding. We bring together students from all regions of Europe and create friendships that break stereotypes and prejudices.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Freedom and human rights are essential elements of a European society. Through our work and behaviour, we aim to serve as an example and spread these values among the youth of our continent.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />A strong Europe is built upon the foundations of respect, tolerance and solidarity. Following these values, we stand for an inclusive society where citizens enjoy equal opportunities and rights.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Progress in Europe has to be based on knowledge and unlimited access to education. By providing diverse learning opportunities and supporting a European dimension in education, we believe it gives young people better opportunities for the future.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />By honoring and promoting these principles we shape a better Europe.","lastUp":"2017-08-16T15:32:45.758+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
