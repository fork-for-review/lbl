Members represent all types of organisations and individuals active for seniors and older persons and all types of ownership including for profit, not-for-profit and governmental. EAHSA’s chapters and members represent more than 3,000 providers in Europe. EAHSA’s vision  is to improve the quality of   life for older persons and to support  its members in making each day a better day for their clients by providing high quality housing, services and care. EAHSA is realizing this vision by giving a voice to the providers for the ageing sector in Europe’s policy debates, raising awareness and understanding of the impact of  European policies among the ageing sector and other interested parties, establishing  good contacts with  EU institutions  and becoming a key network for the providers for the ageing sector. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EAHSA developed Guiding Principles to provide the basis for the way the providers of the ageing sector have to develop its activities in order to keep them viable, sustainable and responsive to future demands and needed developments. &#xd;<br />The headlines of the Five Guiding Principles are: Preserving dignity, Nurturing spirits in life, Comforting in partnership, Encouraging diversity in housing and services, Adopting a carefree and modern approach.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EAHSA does not stand alone in pursuing its vision, values and  mission. It is  affiliated with IAHSA, the International  Association  of  Homes and Services for the Ageing, which is a global network with its office in Washington DC.
