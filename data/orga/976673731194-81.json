As a hub where board members and policy council members are in the governing bodies of their organisations and initiatives it has a unique way of engaging with its stakeholders. PREKURSOR brings together professionals, practitioners, researches and peers from various backgrounds and areas and aims to initiate a public debate on crucial policy issues like the crossroad of psychoactive substances use, sexual activity, public health, social policy and social exclusion. PREKURSOR’s goals are strongly based on human and civil rights and public health. PREKURSOR seeks to promote evidence-based policies on national and local level. The main focus are disadvantaged groups whose fundamental rights are not respected, who do not have access to medical care, legal assistance and other forms of support. The organization conducts activities in the following areas: harm prevention and harm reduction in the context of substance use and sexual behaviours, HIV/HCV and STIs prevention and treatment, drug policy, homelessness, sexual education, mental health. PREKURSOR is conducting the very first sex work project. It works with other vulnerable populations – migrants, youth at risk, inmates. The premise is also research activities and supporting self-organization of communities.","acronym":"Prekursor","interests":"Development, Education, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Youth","euInitiatives":"At an international level, members of the Foundation have been representing civil society at the session of Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna for last few years, including UNGASS in 2016, in The Civil Society Forum on Drugs in the EU (2013-2014), The HIV/AIDS Civil Society Forum, International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe, among others.","lastUp":"2018-04-15T21:51:04.157+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
