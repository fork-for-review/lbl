Established in 2001, the Transatlantic Center is a leading place for transatlantic debate and analysis, and one of the largest U.S. international policy institutions in Europe. The office brings U.S. perspectives to European policy audiences, and brings the work of GMF-wide programs to official and non-government audiences in Brussels. The Transatlantic Center covers the full range of transatlantic issues, with special emphasis on foreign and security policy, trade, energy security, and EU and NATO affairs. The office is the European hub for GMF’s transatlantic leadership initiatives, including the Marshall Memorial Fellowship, the Young Transatlantic Network, and outreach to GMF’s alumni community of over 3,000 leaders. GMF’s programs on Europe, the Mediterranean, the wider Atlantic, and Asia all have a strong presence in Brussels. Hosting over 60 events each year, the Brussels office provides a platform for high level convening, as well as research and analysis on transatlantic issues and strategies.","acronym":"GMF","interests":"Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Energy, Enlargement, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Information Society, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trade, Youth","euInitiatives":"Foreign and security policy, trade/economics, energy security, EU and Europe, the Mediterranean, wider Atlantic,  Asia.","lastUp":"2017-07-18T10:29:00.028+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
