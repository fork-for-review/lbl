Being the European arm of the RAND Corporation, we share its mission and values.&#xd;<br />Over the last twenty years RAND Europe’s work has steadily expanded to cover a kaleidoscope of policy-relevant topics from defence and security, innovation and technology policy, and criminal justice through to health and social issues. Cutting across topical areas are the methods-focused groups, including evaluation and impact measurement, and choice modelling and valuation. The mix of subject expertise, contextual understanding and innovative methodologies creates insightful yet robust analysis.&#xd;<br />We are objective. We realise our mission by conducting objective, relevant research and analysis to create solutions that are both effective and enduring. Our research is designed to find ways to apply quantifiable, disciplined analysis to thorny policy questions.&#xd;<br />We understand the needs of policymakers. Through diversity of experience and expertise, coupled with our interdisciplinary approach to research and analysis and the innovative methods applied, we can address the needs of policymakers.&#xd;<br />We have impact. Whether to advance and inform policy debates, raise an issue up a notch on a policy agenda or to change policy or practice, we work to improve policies that can help people.&#xd;<br />We aim to deliver quality. As part of the RAND Corporation our research conforms to the quality-assured products for which the RAND name has been known for over 60 years.&#xd;<br />We care.
