Membership is open to legal professionals (lawyers, judges), academics and law students.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The objectives of the organisation are:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />To develop co-operation and networking of personal injury lawyers within Europe;&#xd;<br />To promote access to the legal system for consumers suffering personal injury;&#xd;<br />To promote higher standards of care and safety for consumers;&#xd;<br />To promote proper and fair compensation for all personal injury cases;&#xd;<br />To support and encourage the exchange of information and knowledge.&#xd;<br />The development and expansion of PEOPIL is based upon recognition that the issues involved in personal injury litigation frequently extend beyond the national boundaries and require an international perspective and knowledge.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The impact of EC legislation on personal injury law is growing steadily and this creates a need for knowledge of European legislation and a basic understanding of the Member States legislation in this field.","acronym":"PEOPIL","interests":"Banking and financial services, Consumers, General and Institutional Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Single market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Package Travel Directive&#xd;<br />Motor Insurance Directive&#xd;<br />Collective Redress Directive&#xd;<br />General Data Protection Regulation","lastUp":"2018-05-23T15:59:45.369+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
