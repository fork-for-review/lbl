&#xd;<br />\tShare innovation and best practice across sectors locally, nationally and internationally;&#xd;<br />\tSupport competent local and national policy development and delivery.","acronym":"UKHF","interests":"Climate Action, Environment, Public Health","euInitiatives":"We are primarily concerned with the work of DG Santé, particularly Unit C (public health), and health determinants (C3). We engage with DG Santé on non-communicable disease, ranging from advocacy for particular policies, to helping to model the likely projections of non-communicable diseases and costs, and savings from interventions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are also interested in a range of policy areas which have a consequential impact  on health, for example: agriculture with its impact on diet and nutrition; social affairs and its focus on inclusion and anti-discrimination;  regional policy in building cohesion and employment prospects which in turn impact on health; environment focusing on for example air quality; DG connect and the options for limiting health harms caused by health harming products.","lastUp":"2017-08-15T14:29:32.047+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
