As known, this occurred twice in the past. It produced big negative effects: first, with the defeat of the united European armies at Mohács in 1526 and second, when totalitarian systems got a grip on the East, holding it back, between 1945-1989. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Thereafter, with the freedom movements of 1989 and with the EU enlargements of 1995, 2004, 2007 and 2008, we all enjoy new chances to induce impulses in legislation and institutions so that the two parts of the continent converge. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Based on the company motto “EX ORIENTE LUX. EX OCCIDENTE LEX”, we support both Western European (esp. German) as well as South-Eastern European (esp. Romanian) companies, academic institutions and NGOs by developing and managing political contacts in a sound and principle-based manner. We are here for supporting the development of sound pieces of legislation in the above mentioned sense.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We consult strategically and multidisciplinarily, hands-on and result-driven, so that you can develop long-term partnerships across borders. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Individual areas of action comprise:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1. Concepts of political cooperation between parties from Eastern and Western Europe on specific issues: economic &amp; financial policy; foreign policy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. Support MEPs and specialized committees for fully understanding the heavy impact of immigration from people with non-European cultural roots on the EU and the MS. Cooperate with NGOs and demography research institutes. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />3. Participating with relevant inputs for the drafting of EU regulations and directives.&#xd;<br />e.g. for the organic food processing industry: the production and trading with organic raw materials  (grains, etc.) as defined in EC/834/2007.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />4. Participating with relevant inputs for EU legislation  regarding the \"Social Market Economy\" model of economic and social organisation and the model of the \"Dual Vocational Education and Training\" system.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />5. Participating with relevant inputs regarding EU policy towards Israel and related Christian Churches associations and interest groups.","acronym":"TDE","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Enlargement, External Relations, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Humanitarian Aid, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"1.
