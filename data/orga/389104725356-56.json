Together with the USGA, The R&amp;A governs the sport of golf worldwide, operating in separate jurisdictions.  The R&amp;A governs in its jurisdiction, outside of the USA and Mexico, with the consent of 153 organisations, from amateur and professional golf, and on behalf of over 30 million golfers in 140 countries.  The R&amp;A and USGA share a commitment to a single code for the Rules of Golf, Rules of Amateur Status and Equipment Standards. The R&amp;A organises The Open, golfâ€™s oldest and most international Major championship.  The R&amp;A also organises a series of amateur and junior golf events, as well as international matches. The R&amp;A is able to distribute a substantial annual surplus for the development of the sport as a result of staging The Open each year. Emphasis is placed on encouraging junior golf, on the promotion and progression of the sport in emerging golfing nations, on coaching and on the provision of more public golf courses and improved practice facilities.  The R&amp;A also provides best practice guidelines on all aspects of golf course management, to help grow golf throughout the world in a commercially and environmentally sustainable way.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Sport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Directives on water and pesticides.
