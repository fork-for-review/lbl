These values are rooted in the origin of the mutualist movement in the 19th century where people chose to go together and create health funds for their own protection. Nowadays mutual societies in Europe and some other mutual societies in the world fight to preserve these ideas also embodied in health protection bodies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Challenges&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Today AIM reaffirms the validity of its values in front of challenges such as ageing of the population, the prevalence of chronic diseases, rising healthcare expenditure and changes in lifestyles.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AIM members engage for:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Cost-efficient and affordable health systems,&#xd;<br />Strengthened health mutual benefit societies,recognized as such for their value in social economy, &#xd;<br />Health protection for all without inequalities","acronym":"AIM","interests":"Competition, Consumer Affairs, Economic and Financial Affairs, Employment and Social Affairs, Enterprise, Internal Market, Public Health, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"in principle all initiatives, policies and legislative files that have an impact on the members of AIM, so mainly in the field of healthcare, insurance, social security, social economy etc.","lastUp":"2017-03-06T11:36:40.687+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"700000-799999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
