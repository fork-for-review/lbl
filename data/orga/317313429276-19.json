We have set up and manage a database and platform of democratic transformation expertise, a one-stop-shop to look for individual experts or organisations (public, private, NGOs etc).&#xd;<br />We produce high quality analysis, policy documents, occasional papers and research studies, media articles etc. We also function as a platform for debate and multistakeholder engagement, bringing academia, experts, civil society, public institutions and the private sector together in different debate formats around relevant topics.
