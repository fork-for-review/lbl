From the launch in 2009 of proposals for the regulation of OTC derivatives we have acted as a catalyst for the views of the corporate sector in Europe. Our objective is to ensure that through formal response to consultations and proposals, as well as informal contact with all relevant EU institutions, proper account is taken of the likely real economy impact of regulation of the financial sector.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Implementation of SEPA: we have contributed both at&#xd;<br />European level – participating in stakeholders’ meetings, SEPA progress reviews, consultations and expert groups of the EC, European Parliament, ECB and EPC, in working groups with the EPC for Direct Debits and Remittance Information – and at national level, with many associations that are members of the EACT involved in their national SEPA Migration Committees. A particular focus continues to be on the ability of users as SEPA stakeholders to improve the governance of the implementation programme. The Chairman of the EACT is a member of the Euro Retail Payments Board (established by the European Central Bank and the European Commission), representing both the EACT and Business Europe.","lastUp":"2017-02-16T16:13:28.495+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
