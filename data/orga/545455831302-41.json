Growth in the sector in recent years, both in terms of value and jobs, has cemented the sector’s status as a key contributor to economic growth: &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />between 2008 and 2014, tourism GVA grew by 42%, while tourism employment increased in 2015 by 11% to reach 217,000 (9% of employment), the highest level of employment in tourism since the Business Register and Employment Survey began. In 2015, Scotland attracted approximately 14.9 million overnight visitors, which generated £5 billion in visitor expenditure. Further to this 124 million day trips were taken in Scotland with a total spend of £3.9 billion. Taking into account the wider Scottish supply chain, spending by tourists in Scotland generates £11 billion of economic activity in the wider Scottish supply chain and contributes £6 billion to Scottish GDP.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />To deliver our vision and our core purpose, VisitScotland adopts the following strategies:&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />•\tMarketing: we will drive advocacy by inspiring a national movement, helping to facilitate this global advocacy with quality information, content and advice, and empowering and enabling the Scottish tourism industry, in particular our large SME base, to seize the opportunities that the digital economy presents. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tEvents: we will support the delivery of the national events strategy, Scotland the Perfect Stage, working with partners to sustain, develop and promote Scotland’s international profile as one of the world’s foremost public-facing events destinations and as the perfect stage for events. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tQuality &amp; Sustainability: we will promote and facilitate the continuous improvement of total quality of the visitor experience in Scotland, building on the strong foundation and economic impact delivered to date by the Quality Assurance Schemes and ensuring that a sustainable approach is taken to developing the industry.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tInclusive Tourism: we will strive to make tourism in Scotland inclusive and available to all, engaging with and listening to our partners and stakeholders to ensure that every corner of Scotland benefits from tourism. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tInternational Engagement: we will work across a wide range of audiences, including other Team Scotland Partners such as Scottish Government, SDI and VisitBritain; the international travel trade; Associations; other National Tourism Organisations; and academia, alumni and Diaspora networks to better understand international opportunities and optimise the potential that increased internationalisation of the tourism industry represents.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Tourism is more than a holiday experience.
