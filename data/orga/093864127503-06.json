VIU thereby contributes to and is an integral part of the internationalisation strategies of the member organisations.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Role of universities today&#xd;<br />Universities today must play a strategic role in addressing the new global challenges: sustainable development, climate change and energy, food and water security, urban growth, welfare, ageing populations, the widening gap between rich and poor, global ethics, protection of tangible and intangible cultural heritage, human rights, equality, democratization, peace and conflict, global governance, cyber-security.  Some of these critical global issues can be predicted, others arise unexpectedly and suddenly, and traditional training is not necessarily the best way to find solutions. Today's students need to develop different skills, must be able to work across disciplines, to react with great flexibility and a broad intellectual range.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Common campus &#xd;<br />The common campus in Venice creates a sense of community that favors consensus building. Programs are drawn up collegially together, across disciplines, continents, languages and cultures. Students encounter a truly intercultural experience at VIU.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Venice&#xd;<br />One of the advantages is to be in Venice, a living laboratory in a fragile environment with a remarkable cultural heritage where students and professors can directly experience and become aware of some of the common challenges.","acronym":"VIU","interests":"Agriculture, Climate Action, Communication, Consumers, Culture, Education and training, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, Public Health, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"VIU is active in promoting policies for Sustainable Development, at EU and extra-EU level. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EU initiatives include active participation in H2020 projects, carrying out research in environmental policy, focusing on consumers' and policy makers' perspective.
