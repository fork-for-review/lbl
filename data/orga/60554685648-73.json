By working with mainstream companies which buy raw materials in large volumes, we can improve the standard of living of as many farmers as possible at a high pace.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />UTZ is convinced that increasing sustainability should also reinforce the independent position of farmers. This is why farmers are trained in the professionalization of their agricultural practice and operational management. This improves the quality of their products and allows them to produce higher volumes at lower costs. This in turn enables the farmers to negotiate a better price for a better product and to improve their standard of living. Moreover, farmers who work with UTZ in the global marketplace receive a premium for their crop and they don’t have to pay for taking part in the program.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />By working with a Code of Conduct, UTZ sets requirements for the farmers when it comes to the sustainable growing of coffee, cocoa, tea and hazelnuts. Farmers are trained in the area of business skills, labor conditions and environmental management and their operational management is checked by independent third parties. The UTZ tracking system subsequently insures that the raw materials have actually been grown and harvested in a responsible manner.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We want to achieve sustainable agricultural supply chains, where:&#xd;<br />– Farmers are professionals implementing good practices;&#xd;<br />– The food industry takes responsibility by demanding and rewarding sustainable production;&#xd;<br />– Consumers can trust their brands and buy products which meet their expectations &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />UTZ’s field support, traceability system and certification enables markets to reward good practices.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Consumer Affairs, Development, Environment, Food Safety, Trade","euInitiatives":"UTZ follows the policy areas of agriculture, food labeling, public procurement, sustainable development, human rights and related subjects.","lastUp":"2017-03-27T13:43:52.117+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
