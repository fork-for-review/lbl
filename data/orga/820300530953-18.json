We do this by helping countries, their people and their governments address some of the most difficult challenges in the world today. The Institute has four areas of work:Co-existence: We work to promote co-existence and counter extremism by tackling the ideology behind violence, not just the violence itself. Governance: We work with governments and leaders of fragile, developing and emerging states to enhance their effectiveness. Middle East: We work to support increased stability and understanding in the Middle East. Renewing the Centre: We work to revitalise the centre ground of politics and equip todayâ€™s leaders to combat the rise of false populism.","acronym":"TBI","interests":"Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Humanitarian Aid, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"TBI aims to help make globalisation work for the many, not the few.
