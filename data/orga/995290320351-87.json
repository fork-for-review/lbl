These activities may include working with the major stakeholders in the field of these diseases, interacting  with EU and national institutions, advocacy on issues pertaining to hepatitis, commissioning studies, disseminating into the public domain material on the burden of these diseases, organising national and international conferences, high-level meetings and summits and assisting regulators and other stakeholders in the implementation of viral hepatitis programmes. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since 2016, HepBCPPA is one of the main advocates of the  elimination of hepatitis C in Europe by 2030.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />In 2016, HepBCPPA together with the main stakeholders in the field of hepatitis, organized the First EU HCV Policy Summit on the elimination of hepatitis C in Europe  in Brussels on 17th February 2016 entitled  ?Hepatitis C: The beginning of the end - key elements for successful European and national strategies to eliminate HCV in Europe?.   The event brought together 120  EU and national policy-makers, experts and influencers from across Europe, in an exceptional multi-stakeholder set-up to discuss and agree how we can effectively work towards the elimination of hepatitis C in Europe by 2030. &#xd;<br />EU Commissioner for Health V.
