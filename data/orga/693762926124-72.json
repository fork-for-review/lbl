In Malawi and Uganda the organization work under the banner ‘health as a leverage for rights’, which denote a commitment to ensuring access to information and treatment regardless of sexual orientation. In both countries homosexual acts are criminalized with up to 14 years imprisonment, hence advocacy is essential and the organization works hard – in cooperation with its local partners – to ensure support from local and traditional leaders.
