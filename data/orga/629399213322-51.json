ECCF works to increase understanding of the organisation and delivery of critical care, raise awareness of factors that lead to unequal and inequitable outcomes, and trigger action across Europe to overcome those barriers.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ECCF looks at particular critical conditions and services and works by: &#xd;<br />•\tIdentifying, through evidence-based, multidisciplinary research, the non-medical factors that influence the delivery of care to critically ill patients. These may include physical and administrative infrastructures, institutions and economics, public attitudes and awareness.&#xd;<br />•\tDeveloping recommendations in partnership with key stakeholders, which if implemented, would lead to improved outcomes for patients. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tInitiating targeted advocacy activities in the EU institutions, in collaboration with partners at both EU and national level to improve the delivery of care. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Topics addressed by ECCF include: &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />‘Improving Access to Primary Angioplasty’: This work looked into the structural factors that limit the delivery of primary angioplasty to treat acute heart attack patients in Europe and which therefore increase mortality and morbidity in those patients. These factors result in variations in outcomes across Europe, despite studies which indicate that this is a clinically-proven best treatment. &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />ECCF’s work on extremely pre-term births, entitled ‘Outcomes in the Eye of the Beholder’ looked at the factors limiting decision-making for extremely premature infants. Decision-making guidelines vary widely across Europe and may have very different consequences for the patient, their families and society. ECCF aims to highlight these disparities, and develop recommendations relating to neonatal policies and practices that better support decision-makers in these critical situations. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />in 2015, ECCF looked at the decline in the use of autopsy procedures across Europe and asked whether this trend is depriving medical science of information that is needed to feed back into more accurate diagnoses of critically ill patients. The aim of the project is to improve understanding of the reasons for, and implications of the decline in this procedure.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2016, started a new workstream looking to improve outcomes for critically ill children. The project looks at different points in the care pathway where implementation of evidence-based medicine could make a significant difference to outcomes - optimal orientation and management of critically ill children in pre-hospital settings; implementation of paediatric guidelines in the management of sepsis; and the need for a registry of paediatric intensive care as a basis for improving standards of care across Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ECCF has joined the Integrated Care Working Group of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing and will promote the role of optimal care at the 'critical' end of the care continuum in reducing the risk of developing chronic conditions and future needs for medical treatment and care.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Looking ahead, ECCF plans to develop the portfolio of critical care issues that it addresses. We address topics which reveal hidden problems, areas of medical and scientific practice that are misunderstood or neglected, for a variety of largely non-medical reasons ranging from organisational and administrative issues, to cultural and ethical factors. They merit out attention because they have the potential to bring significant improvements to patients, healthcare providers and other stakeholders through the application of our particular multi-disciplinary approach.","acronym":"ECCF","interests":"Public Health","euInitiatives":"Quality and Safety of Care&#xd;<br />Cross-Border Healthcare Directive&#xd;<br />Integrated Care &#xd;<br />Revision of the Paediatric Regulation","lastUp":"2018-03-02T16:18:13.584+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
