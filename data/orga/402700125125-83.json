Today we count more than 100 members. In a world of increasing internationalism, legislation, environment, the media and trade are all now multinational by nature. The combined strength of our members, and a close cooperation with national outdoor associations, provides us with an extremely powerful force to represent the European outdoor industry in a constructive and positive manner.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EOG strongly believes that increased participation in outdoor sports will benefit both individuals and society as a whole.  We share a vision with many others in our industry, to encourage people of all ages and in all locations to be active outdoors.","acronym":"EOG","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Audiovisual and Media, Budget, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, External Relations, Information Society, Internal Market, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"- EU Workplan for Sport&#xd;<br />- White Paper for Sport&#xd;<br />- Developing the European Dimension of Sport&#xd;<br />- European Week of Sports &#xd;<br />- Erasmus+ Programme&#xd;<br />- Trade and Customs&#xd;<br />- Intellectual Property Rights&#xd;<br />- Single Digital Market&#xd;<br />- Internal Market&#xd;<br />- CSR &amp; Sustainability","lastUp":"2017-12-19T09:24:27.429+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"800000-899999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
