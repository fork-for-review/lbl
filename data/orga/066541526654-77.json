We formulate and promote economic policy solutions that strengthen individual opportunity, social cohesion and environmental stability. We pursue goals, not ideologies; we believe in the effectiveness of markets as well as in the need for appropriate policy frameworks; and we focus on bold but pragmatic and concrete steps rather than grand redesigns. Our impact is reflected in policy change.","acronym":"CEP","interests":"Budget, Competition, Economic and Financial Affairs, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Internal Market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"CCCTB, TiSA, TTIP","lastUp":"2017-04-07T11:22:58.086+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
