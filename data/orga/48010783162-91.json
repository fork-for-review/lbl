These will vary but currently include the implementation of the Construction Products Directive, fire protection in construction, the environment and raw materials. It provides contact for its Members with European governmental institutions as well as with other construction industry associations: architects, contractors, developers, etc. It also liaises with European construction materials sectorial organisations, the majority of which have joined Construction Products Europe as Associate Members.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Construction Products Europe monitors European legislative, administrative and economic measures affecting the construction materials and building products industry, and ensures, whenever possible, that the industry's interests are taken into account. To achieve this, it strives to obtain from its Members consensual industry views on important pan-European issues.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />On 1st January 2018, Construction Products Europe represents 18 full members and 33 associate members (list available on our web site).","acronym":"","interests":"Business and Industry, Competition, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market","euInitiatives":"- Construction Product Regulation&#xd;<br />- Resource Efficiency opportunities in the building sector&#xd;<br />- Smart CE Marking&#xd;<br />- Digitalisation","lastUp":"2018-04-25T11:20:27.513+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
