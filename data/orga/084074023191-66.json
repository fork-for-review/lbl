It was constituted by a group of different people (PLHIV, doctors, SW, PWID, lawyers, activists…) who felt a strong need to combat the AIDS emergency and address the needs of PLHIV in Milan, the most affected Italian city. In the Eighties, in Italy AIDS was mostly spreading through injecting drug use and needle exchange. LILA Milano was the first NGO to introduce needle exchange programs in Italy through mobile units at the beginning of the Nineties and still nowadays advocates for harm reduction policies.  In 2010, LILA Milano members voted for its transformation into Foundation for scientific and psychosocial research.  LILA Milano is part of LILA Onlus, a national umbrella organisation that was constituted in 1987 and presently counts 13 units in various Italian regions.  LILA is an important NGO in the country, represented in many bodies. It is part of the National AIDS Commission of the MoH and of the Council of Associations working on HIV/AIDS.  It is also part of European networks (AIDS Action Europe, Correlation, EuroHRN, Cobatest…).  A member of the BoD co-chaired the HIV/AIDS Civil Society Forum from 2012 to 2015 and is presently the Italian member of the Forum.  &#xd;<br />LILA Milano is the more structured unit of the national association and has developed programs/activities in different areas: 1. Information: dedicated helpline for telephone counselling (+390289455320), e-mail service (infoaids@lilamilano.it), website (www.lilamilano.it). 2.  Prevention: interventions targeted to specific groups, i.e. youth in schools, PWID and SW through outreach mobile units, prisoners in prisons, MSM at their meeting venues, migrants in their native languages, etc.; offer of rapid tests for HIV and HCV at LILA premises or different settings.  3.  Protection of human rights: advocacy for eliminating health inequalities, legal advice to victims of stigma/discrimination. 4.  Support and assistance: psychological support, medical advice, legal assistance, job orientation, self-help groups for PLHIV. 5. Psycho-social research.&#xd;<br />In the course of the 27 years of its history, LILA Milano maintained its overall goals, which can be summarized as follows: HIV prevention, support to PLHIV and key affected populations, defence of human rights, contrast to stigma and discrimination, promotion of universal access to prevention, testing, treatment and care. Furthermore, during the years, it focused on new, more specific objectives, which have been identified through the participation to different contexts at national, European and international level.  In the last decade, the common European objectives set in the most important events and documents (the Dublin Declaration, the Vilnius and Bremen Declarations, the two EU Communications “Combating HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries” and related Action Plans, the guidelines established by international agencies and other initiatives have had a big impact on its strategies and objectives.  Also, the changing needs of PLHIV have brought about many changes.  Current objectives comprise the prevention of – and increased attention to - other infections in addition to HIV, i.e. hepatitis, TB and STIs.  Prevention efforts are better tailored toward hard-to-reach/key affected populations (MSM, PWID, migrants, prisoners, sex workers) and aim at the earlier detection of HIV infections and reduction of late presenters, at the improvement of linkage to care and retention in care of the diagnosed people.   LILA Milano objectives also include facilitating the links between European and national levels, improving the exchange and participation of Italian stakeholders to the European context, joining advocacy actions and campaigns presently mainly focused on affordability of treatments,  universal access to prevention, testing, treatment and care and on combating stigma and discrimination, still representing a problem.","acronym":"F. LILA Milano ONLUS","interests":"Communication, Education, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"Fondazione LILA Milano ONLUS, through its elected representative selected by LILA, is a member of the European HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and TB Civil Society Forum.&#xd;<br />In such role the organization is following the renewal process of a policy framework on HIV for the future years.  In fact, the present Action Plan deriving from the EU Communication for Combating HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries 2009 - 2013 was prolonged until 2016 also thanks to the successful advocacy efforts of the CSF. However, a longer timeframe is needed to keep HIV/AIDS on the political agenda of the Commission. In 2017, joint activities of all stakeholders to ensure further and sustainable commitment in the response to HIV/AIDS and the other disease areas with the involvement of Civil Society continue. In in 2017, the CSF continues its advocacy activities for a comprehensive commitment taking into account an integrated approach in the response to HIV, Tuberculosis and viral Hepatitis as mono-infections and consideration of the neighbouring countries. This will be of crucial importance with regards to the preparation of the World AIDS Conference in Amsterdam 2018 focusing on the eastern European and central Asian countries.","lastUp":"2017-08-30T19:17:59.076+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
