All the information and tools on this website are offered free of charge.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />FCCT was set up because there was no farmer led organisation to provide practical support for farmers in neither this area nor providing a clear farmer informed platform on the importance and urgency to tackle climate change.","acronym":"FCCT","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Environment, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"Greenhouse gas emissions from Agriculture and LULUCF","lastUp":"2017-04-12T10:01:09.466+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
