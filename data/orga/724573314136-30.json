EUSE provides a platform for networking with other organisations and  associations at European and worldwide level.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Role and Activities&#xd;<br />The main activities of the European Union of Supported Employment include:&#xd;<br />• Organising the EUSE Conference, which is held bi-annually: Rotterdam, Netherlands 1994, Dublin, Ireland 1995; Oslo, Norway 1997; Rome, Italy 1999; Edinburgh, Scotland 2001, Helsinki, Finland 2003, Barcelona, Spain 2005, Belfast, Northern Ireland 2007 and Prague, Czech Republic 2009.&#xd;<br />• Exchanging information via regular mail shots, and now, thanks to this project through newsletters, email and website (www.euse.org).&#xd;<br />• Influencing European social and economic policy.&#xd;<br />• Networking with other European Associations and working with worldwide organisations.&#xd;<br />• Developing new National Associations – assisting and supporting organisations to establish their own National Associations&#xd;<br />• Campaigning and lobbying for the rights of people with significant disabilities to access vocational training and employment.&#xd;<br />• Researching and developing models of good practice, staff training, quality standards, self-advocacy, capacity building and legislation.&#xd;<br />• Membership services and support for National Associations&#xd;<br />EUSE is a non-Government organisation and is a member of the European Disability Forum (EDF).","acronym":"EUSE","interests":"Communication, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Enterprise, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Youth","euInitiatives":"EUSE follows all policies, initiative and legislative files that could have an impact on the labour inclusion of disadvantaged groups, especially those related to fundamental rights, citizenship, employment and social policies","lastUp":"2018-03-29T09:40:47.555+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
