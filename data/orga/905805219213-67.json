It represents stakeholders of both the fishing sector (including catching, processing and marketing sectors, and trade unions), and other groups of interest (environmental and development NGOs and civil society). It is currently composed by 50 members from 12 EU coastal Member States. It is recognised in the CFP Regulation (UE) No 1380/2013 as an organization aiming a European Interest.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Its mission is to provide advice to the European Institutions (Commission, Council and Parliament) and EU Member States on matters related to Fisheries Agreements with Third Countries, relations with Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) in which the EU is a contracting party, or with international organizations in whose waters the Community Fleet is operating, as well as on business relations and the international market for fishing products.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Its main goal is to promote the conservation of marine biodiversity and the sustainable use of fishing resources. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />More specifically, it is focused on three key areas of work:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1. Fighting against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing. &#xd;<br />The LDAC is actively engaged with the European Commission, the Member States, the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) and the NGO coalition against IUU fishing on this topic. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. Promoting all elements of the external dimension of the CFP and its coordination with EU environmental, development for cooperation, health and trade policies. Seeking for compliance of international legal instruments in the promotion of human and labour rights of fish workers and across the entire fishing value chain.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />3.
