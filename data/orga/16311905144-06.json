Currently 35 privacy and civil rights organisations have EDRI membership. They are based or have offices in 18 different countries in Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Members of European Digital Rights have joined forces to defend civil rights in the information society. The need for cooperation among organizations active in Europe is increasing as more regulation regarding the internet, copyright and privacy is originating from European institutions, or from International institutions with strong impact in Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Some examples of regulations and developments that have the attention of European Digital Rights are the ePrivacy directive, the implementation of the GDPR, the copyright directive, mass surveillance and cross border access to e-evidence, the review of the telecom package and net neutrality, privatised law enforcement, trade agreements and internet governance.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />European Digital Rights takes an active interest in developments regarding these subjects in all 45 member states of the Council of Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since January 2003, European Digital Rights produces EDRI-gram, a bi-weekly newsletter about digital civil rights in Europe.","acronym":"EDRi","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Consumer Affairs, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Home Affairs, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and Technology, Trade","euInitiatives":"- ePrivacy directive&#xd;<br />- Data Protection Regulation implementation&#xd;<br />- cross border access to electronic evidence&#xd;<br />- Copyright directive&#xd;<br />- Audiovisual media services directive&#xd;<br />- Anti-terrorism directive&#xd;<br />- Digital Single Market&#xd;<br />- Resolutions on trade agreements&#xd;<br />- European Electronic Communications Code directive&#xd;<br />- Berec","lastUp":"2018-04-11T18:46:37.681+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
