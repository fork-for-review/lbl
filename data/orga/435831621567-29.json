It is financed from membership fees, public entities and project funds. Currently it has seven employees and operates according to the triple-helix model. It is a partnership between municipalities, businesses, regional associations, county councils, and universities in the four northernmost counties of Sweden, which cover about 50 % of the country. The overall aim is to provide a hub for exchanging information and fostering initiatives enabling the region to play a leading role in the transition to a sustainable society, economically, socially and ecologically. Key objectives include nurturing the transition from fossil to renewable energy sources in order to mitigate climate change, increase self‐sufficiency and promote regional development. Focal areas are renewable energy with emphasis on transport systems and products based on forest biomass.","acronym":"BFR","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Environment, Regional Policy, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Skogens roll i Eus Kliamt och Energipolitk&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Biomassa Policy och hållaberhetsdirektiv inom förnybarhetsdirektiv","lastUp":"2017-05-03T14:26:09.269+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
