Many of the speakers from the conference, drawn from the leaders of the Scientific, Conservation, Policy, and Commercial sectors, gathered at Fishmongers Hall in December 2009 and made the commitment to work together around a shared vision of the eels return to abundance and so SEG was formed. Today SEG memberships are drawn from across Europe and no one country can have a majority of votes. The daily and operational management is led by the Chairman with the leaders of Science, Conservation and Commercial – there is a further support team of two – one for operations and another for projects.&#xd;<br />Our objectives:&#xd;<br />- To help deliver the objectives of the EU Eel Regulation&#xd;<br />- To develop, decipher and apply sound science to inform effective decision making&#xd;<br />- To influence policy makers at European and National levels&#xd;<br />- To encourage well regulated and sustainable fisheries that support local economies and communities&#xd;<br />- To promote greater public understanding of the eel&#xd;<br />- To be effective at seeking income and resources to progress the aims of the group","acronym":"SEG","interests":"Customs, Environment, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Trade","euInitiatives":"Common Fisheries Policies&#xd;<br />The EU Eel Regulation &#xd;<br />Water Framework Directive&#xd;<br />The Habitats Directive&#xd;<br />Illegal fishing and trade","lastUp":"2018-05-11T11:06:57.221+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
