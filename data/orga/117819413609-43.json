In excess of 80% of legislation, which has an impact on businesses within the Member States of the Union, is now initiated and approved at EU level.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />For many organisations the diverse and complex institutions of the EU are a mystery which absorbs precious time and resources. Organisations do recognise, however, the need to interact with the Council, the Commission and the Parliament. They must be able to participate in debates before policy decisions or legislation impacting on them, are made.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our experienced GHB team offers a range of services. We pride ourselves on the ‘personal touch’ as we steer our clients through the intricacies of the EU, and achieve for each of them an optimum solution. We provide support through:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tProviding information and advice on EU policies and directives likely to impact on the client's activities.&#xd;<br />•\tMonitoring existing and proposed legislation or regulations in the clients area of operation.&#xd;<br />•\tFacilitating communication with MEPs, Commission Officials and other decision makers.&#xd;<br />•\tActively lobbying on behalf of the client primarily in the European Parliament and European Commission, but also with other relevant institutions.","acronym":"GHB","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Competition, Economic and Financial Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Home Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and Technology, Transport","euInitiatives":"Horizon 2020","lastUp":"2017-05-23T13:00:00.380+01:00","customers":"MAC plc,Quintiles Ltd,Johnson &amp; Johnson","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":"0-99999"}
