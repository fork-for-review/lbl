The principal aim of the organisation is to improve, through a range of support services, conditions for people living with HIV and AIDS and/or Hepatitis, their families and their caregivers while further promoting sexual health in the general population. Our mission and vision is to contribute towards a significant reduction in the incidence and prevalence of HIV in Ireland and towards the realisation of an AIDS-free generation by advocating for individuals living with HIV, preventing new HIV infections and combating HIV-related stigma and discrimination.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since 1987, HIV Ireland has been pioneering services in sexual health education and promotion, and has consistently engaged in lobbying and campaigning in the promotion of human rights. Our approach broadly reflects a harm minimisation model which emphasises practical rather than idealised goals.","acronym":"","interests":"Education, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"HIV Ireland is only beginning to involve itself more regularly within the EU.
