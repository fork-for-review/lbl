Currently, HFHR is one of the most experienced and professionally active non-governmental organizations engaged in the field of human rights in Europe. HFHR’s mission includes promotion of human rights as the foundation of a democratic state and acting in order to improve the standards of human rights protection. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />HFHR’s activity consists of monitoring, education (both at the national and international level) and activity in the public interest (including legal programmes providing legal aid and conducting strategic litigation). Since 2007, the HFHR has held a consultancy status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).","acronym":"HFHR","interests":"Justice and Fundamental Rights","euInitiatives":"Within its activity in international research and monitoring networks, HFHR closely follows EU legislation which involves human rights protection. This activity embraces mainly research and monitoring of implementation of certain pieces of EU’s legislation regarding human rights. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As part of the FRANET network, in recent years HFHR has carried out numerous research concerning fundamental rights protection and implementation of EU law in Poland. The recently published reports include, among others, the following issues: child-friendly justice (http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2017/child-friendly-justice-childrens-view), rights of victims of hate crimes (http://fra.europa.eu/en/country-data/2016/country-studies-project-victim-support-services-eu-overview-and-assessment-victims), and severe forms of labour exploitation (http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2015/severe-labour-exploitation-workers-moving-within-or-european-union) or promoting the participation of migrants and their descendants (http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2017/migrant-participation). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Through participation in the JUSTICIA European Rights Network, HFHR monitors and promotes the implementation of EU legislation on procedural rights in criminal proceedings. The most recent engagement concerned the Directive 2012/13/EU on the right to information. HFHR produced a report on the Directive’s implementation in Poland. As a member of the network, HFHR also consults and promotes network publications, including guides on the procedural safeguards (publications available here: http://eujusticia.net/index.php/proceduralrights). &#xd;<br />Procedural rights are also a subject of HFHR’s interest as part of its activity within the LEAP network coordinated by the Fair Trials International. HFHR experts regularly take part in LEAP conferences and meetings, and voice opinions on the situation in Poland. In recent years, in cooperation with many European partner non-governmental organisations, HFHR has also carried out research regarding: rights of minor perpetrators of crimes (http://beta.hfhr.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HFPC_dzieci_po_drugiej_stronie_muru.pdf), monitoring of places where children are deprived of liberty (http://www.childrensrightsbehindbars.eu/images/Guide/DCI-Practical-Guide-EN.pdf) and report on the right to information in criminal procedure (http://www.hfhr.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dyrektywa_ca%C5%82o%C5%9B%C4%871.pdf)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2017, HFHR plans to conduct research on the European Arrest Warrant, procedural rights of the arrested persons and rights of victims of crimes.","lastUp":"2017-03-30T17:31:48.495+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
