The consortium offers a unique contribution to food safety research discussions through workshops and seminars where representatives from research, universities, industry, consumer groups, regulators and assessors share expertise and further develop an integrated vision of where food safety is and where it needs to be. SAFE builds partnerships among organisations with different missions to further a single agenda: Food safety for today and tomorrow.","acronym":"SAFE","interests":"Food Safety","euInitiatives":"ETP Food for Life, H2020 research programming and calls, ActInPak COST Action, EFSA consultations","lastUp":"2017-08-02T14:26:32.567+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
