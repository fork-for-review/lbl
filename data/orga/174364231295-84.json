The main areas of focus are education, safety and care as well as medical care. Sophia for Children operates solely through donations and funds generated from special programs, activities and charity events. &#xd;<br />Our main activities concentrate on children in Kenya aiming to provide security and safety, board and lodging, healthcare, education and recreation to children in need focusing on abandoned and abused children, HIV positive, children held in prisons.&#xd;<br />After 2013 economic crisis in Cyprus, using our experience in Kenya, we implemented our program \"I cook and I offer\" in all-day primary schools in Cyprus. This program, which is endorsed by the Ministry of Education and Culture, supports children in primary schools with lunch. The education process of the children is thus ensured and the children can continue to learn and progress without any targeting or racism.","acronym":"","interests":"Culture, Education and training, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Youth","euInitiatives":"Humanitarian Aid, Access to Education, Girls Protection and Empowerment, Youth Empowerment, Access to Health, Access to Water, Protection of Human Rights, HIV medical support, Preservation of Culture, Women Groups Employment Opportunities.","lastUp":"2018-04-27T15:32:55.981+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
