The refinery specialises in cane sugar refining and was built as part of the EU 2006 Sugar Reform.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The main focus of our activity in Brussels is ensuring that EU legislation treats cane sugar refining in a parallel and fair way to our main European competitor, sugar from beet.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />SRB is almost unique in Europe in focusing solely on cane sugar. Our cane sugar supply chain stretches across developing countries around the world.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Sugar is a very heavily regulated market in Europe. Cane sugar currently accounts for around 17% of the total sugar and isoglucose availability in Europe. Beet sugar accounts for around 78% and isoglucose around 5%. In the global sugar market the situation is the reverse, with cane sugar playing the lead role. Cane sugar accounts for around 78% of total sugar production, with beet accounting for 22%.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Around 70% of Europe’s cane sugar imports are typically sourced from developing countries with which the EU has a preferential trading relationship. These relationships are formalised under both the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and the Everything But Arms Agreements (EBA). The remaining 30% of cane sugar imports are largely sourced under the “CXL” quota. This is a quota that exists as a result of trade negotiations with countries that previously supplied countries that have subsequently joined the EU. The vast majority of this sugar is subject to a €98 per tonne import duty.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The operation of the EU sugar market is governed by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Until 2017, this sets production limits, through quotas, for beet and isoglucose, and defines the terms for importing from preferential and other cane sugar suppliers. High import duties exist for imports sourced from outside of the preferential suppliers. The basic import duty for cane sugar is €339 per tonne, but can be supplemented by further duties when world prices for sugar are low.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />After 2017, the quotas for beet and isoglucose will disappear, but the duties on raw sugar imports will remain. This poses a very real threat to cane refiners such as SRB.","acronym":"SRB","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Climate Action, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, General and Institutional Affairs, Internal Market, Trade","euInitiatives":"Main EU activities include:&#xd;<br />•\tCampaigning for a level playing field in the EU sugar market, in particular as regards access to raw material for cane sugar refiners&#xd;<br />•\tBuilding relationships with Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), in particular following the introduction of co-decision in European agricultural policy&#xd;<br />•\tBuilding relationships with the European Commission and the Permanent Representations in Brussels &#xd;<br />•\tFollowing various international trade dossiers&#xd;<br />•\tFollowing various competition dossiers","lastUp":"2017-09-26T10:46:21.698+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
