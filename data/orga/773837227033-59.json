This is reflected in several areas such as anticipating new trends, increasing the network of partner exchange and information, cooperation of efforts to solve common problems, privileged access to European and national best environmental practices as well as their replicability in regional and local contexts.&#xd;\nLIPOR is associate member of:&#xd;\nACR+, APESB-Associação Portuguesa de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental, APQ-Associação Portuguesa para a Qualidade, AVALER-Associação de Entidades de Valorização Energética de Resíduos Sólidos Urbanos, BCSD, CEWEP, COTEC Portugal, ECN-European Compost Network, ESGRA-Associação para a Gestão de Resíduos, GRACE, ISWA and Smart Waste Portugal","memberOrga":"The relationship between LIPOR and its EMPLOYEES assumes major importance in its sustainability project. For LIPOR the employees are identified as a higher influence and higher dependency in LIPOR project. The investment in the internal human resource are reflected in training and education of employees, as a way to qualified and ensure the excellence of the Organisation.&#xd;\nBearing in mind the importance of all stakeholders of LIPOR, and their importance for the performance activities, there are different levels of involvement and particular concerns and interests for each stakeholder.&#xd;\nThroughout the last decade, LIPOR has been analysing the importance of its different Stakeholders for the sustainable management of the Organisation, in terms of shared value. In 2010, we started the process of Stakeholder involvement according to the principles of the AA1000APS (2008) standard, which was used as an instrument of transparency and corporate governance. This standard is based on learning and social, ethical, environmental and economic performance of Organisations, guiding them towards a Sustainability Strategy through their relationship with their Stakeholders. Being aware that the establishment of synergies with its Stakeholders allows it to align with activity with their values and expectations, LIPOR developed a consultation and involvement process with two-year cycles, thus ensuring an adequate response to organisational and business changes.&#xd;\nBased on the basic criteria of importance, relevance and influence regarding the main themes of the sector, the identification of the main Stakeholders allows LIPOR to focus on the essential. The consultation and involvement instruments used are diverse and adapted to the characteristics of each Stakeholder, promoting a clear and objective communication with them and thus enabling a more complete analysis of their perception of all of LIPOR’s areas. &#xd;\nTherefore, in order to integrate the Stakeholders’ concerns and expectations into LIPOR’s sustainable management, the Management Team has analysed the results obtained, both at a strategic and at a communication and dissemination level, and several specific projects were developed, which will be approached throughout the Report. To define sustainability materiality means to deeply analyse the Organisation and establish the indicators which are important for the business, on the basis of specific criteria. In this context, LIPOR built a materiality matrix based on the materially relevant aspects identified, both because of the importance Stakeholders give to the themes and the perception of LIPOR’s performance regarding those themes.","goal":"LIPOR – Intermunicipal Waste Management of Greater Porto, Portugal, is responsible for the management, recovery and treatment of the municipal waste produced in the eight associated municipalities: Espinho, Gondomar, Maia, Matosinhos, Porto, Póvoa de Varzim, Valongo and Vila do Conde.
