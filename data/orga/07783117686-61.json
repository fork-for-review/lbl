We currently have offices in London, Brussels, Berlin and Washington DC, together with a regular presence in China.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The core of our capability lies with our diverse, experienced and creative staff. E3Gâ€™s founding directors have unique experience working on energy, environment, security policy and diplomacy challenges in the UK Foreign Ministry, Prime Minister's Strategy Unit and as senior political advisors. See the section People for more information.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />E3G was founded in 2004 to address the challenge of how to deliver transformational policy change. Our experience has been that the main obstacles to sustainable development lie not in a lack of analysis or available resources, but in the silo-based nature of institutions and decision makers. We therefore work to align politics and policy to leverage strategic outcomes.","acronym":"E3G","interests":"Budget, Climate Action, Competition, Development, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Internal Market, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Energy, Climate, Environment, Resource efficiency, Energy Union, Better Regulation, Jobs, Growth, Investment &amp; Competitiveness, External Policy, Trade, etc.","lastUp":"2017-10-30T12:08:38.953+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
