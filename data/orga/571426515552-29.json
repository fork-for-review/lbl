Spectrum is thus a crucial part of any ICT agenda today and it remains one of the cornerstones of e.g. the European Union Radio Spectrum Policy Programme. With the move from traditional Command &amp; Control spectrum assignment to market forces and recently to shared use of spectrum the field is becoming very complicated.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />We focus in helping clients understand and evaluate the opportunities and risks in various spectrum management scenarios. The organisation's goal is to promote solutions that make spectrum use efficient whether in exclusive, licence-exempt or shared fashion.","acronym":"","interests":"Enterprise, Information Society","euInitiatives":"RSPP, spectrum policy in general.
