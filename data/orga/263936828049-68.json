Our founding members represent over 18,000 fishermen and 3,500 vessels all directly impacted by Brexit. We have come together to ensure that the Brexit agreement takes into account the economic and social realities of fishing and coastal communities across Europe. Also at stake here is the fundamentally transboundary and interdependent nature of fishing activities in the North Sea, waters west of Scotland, the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea as well as the Channel.","acronym":"EUFA","interests":"Fisheries and Aquaculture","euInitiatives":"All fisheries issues related to the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union","lastUp":"2017-08-21T11:59:43.298+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
