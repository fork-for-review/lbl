People all around the world are feeling the effects.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Nature is the natural resource base on which all humans depend. Species and habitat diversity are prerequisites of a quality environment. Our aim is a European continent that hosts free-flowing rivers, pristine forests, diverse cultural landscapes as well as sufficient space for wild animals and migrating birds within these and other ecosystems. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are committed to connecting people and nature in a peaceful Europe – beyond national borders. Our efforts for the protection of plants, animals and habitats are transboundary in nature; we strengthen local conservation organizations and create international networks between them. Together with our Europe-wide partner network we create solutions that allow humans to live and work in harmony with nature.","acronym":"EuroNatur","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Culture, Education, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, Regional Policy, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Green Infrastructure and Restoration&#xd;<br />Biodiversity Strategy&#xd;<br />Common Agricultural Policy&#xd;<br />Climate Action","lastUp":"2018-03-28T12:38:24.634+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
