We transform information from devices, vehicles, infrastructure and other sources into real-time location services that play a key role in how we move, live and interact with one another.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />When HERE started 30 years ago, a map was a folded piece of paper. Today, interactive maps are on every smartphone and we’re paving the way towards autonomous driving. Where will we be tomorrow? HERE is always on the lookout for new talent to help us navigate the cities of the future and drive company growth.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Maps remain at the heart of the HERE mission. But what we are building today is, of course, very different from our earliest maps. We’ve evolved from static visualizations to cloud-enabled, live representations of a world in constant motion. With the backing of leading automotive companies, we are ready to deliver the next generation of mobility and location-based services for companies big and small.","acronym":"HERE","interests":"Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Participation in the C-ITS platform phase1 and 2 (by DG MOVE) as well as ITS Directive","lastUp":"2017-09-27T08:15:49.646+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1000000-1249999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
