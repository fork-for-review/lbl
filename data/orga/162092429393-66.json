Working at the intersection of business and government, our lawyers have significant EU law experience and a detailed knowledge and understanding of the European institutions. The focus of our work is on legal advice that does not fall within the scope of the register (i.e. advice to clients on legal or administrative proceedings, on compliance with law, on the impact of regulatory changes, and representation in legal proceedings). However, Hogan Lovells also offers to support clients, via representation or mediation, in their participation in the EU's political processes including the provision of tactical or strategic advice and the drafting of advocacy material.","acronym":"Hogan Lovells","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Customs, Economic and Financial Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and Technology, Trade, Transport","euInitiatives":"The EU policies we follow include competition, life sciences, export control, economic sanctions, customs, trade, technology &amp; media, transport, Digital Single Market, privacy, security and defence, energy, food &amp; environment law.","lastUp":"2017-12-21T11:36:43.295+01:00","customers":"Nike","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":"0-99999"}
