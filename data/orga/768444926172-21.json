Throughout its history it has trained more than quarter of a million teachers, more than 30 thousand university professors and scientists for more than 100 countries. MSPU is the largest higher education institution in Russia in the field of teacher training: it is, de facto, \"the main pedagogical institution of the country\", determining the development policy of pedagogical education, and also the Russian education system as a whole.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Its mission is to provide progressive models for other Russian pedagogical universities. The competence-based, interactive teaching strategy involves the traditional and innovative approaches, contemporary theories and applied knowledge as the main competitive factor of teachers.
