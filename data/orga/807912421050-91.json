Stimulating more economic activity and jobs by creating the right regulatory environment, removing unreasonable taxes.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />4. Making Air Passenger Rights simple and clear by providing clarity to the EC Regulation 261/2004; advocating politicians to limit the recourse to both national and EU Courts for interpretation of the Regulation.","acronym":"A4E","interests":"Budget, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Customs, Economic and Financial Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Internal Market, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"- Single European Sky&#xd;<br />- EU Aviation Strategy&#xd;<br />- Airport Charges Directive&#xd;<br />- Air Passenger Rights&#xd;<br />- EU ETS for aviation and environmental policies&#xd;<br />- EASA Basic Regulation&#xd;<br />- Security policies","lastUp":"2018-02-08T16:15:51.613+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1000000-1249999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
