It acts as a think tank to discuss and debate key issues in digital policy and provides an umbrella organisation for a range of co-regulatory measures in the digital industry. We are calling for suitable regulatory methods to foster innovation and the digital transformation and, at the same time, promote corporate social responsibility, in particular with regard to the appropriate measures for data and consumer protection. The instruments here cover a spectrum from enhancing the transparency of services and data processing and strengthening best practices in digital security to binding voluntary commitments from industry underpinned by sanctions.","acronym":"SCOPE Europe","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Communication, Consumer Affairs, Enterprise, General and Institutional Affairs, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"DSM-Strategy, Data Privacy, Community of Practice for better Self- and Co-Regulation","lastUp":"2017-11-30T10:15:24.148+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
