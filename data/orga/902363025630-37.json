This situation is worse for critical and strategic metals. Critical metals are considered risky, in short supply or both by industrial sectors, for example metals for applications in electric vehicle or aerospace. Strategic and critical metals are essential to member states strategies, for example renewable energy policies. Therefore, future of European industries might be jeopardised by these dependences on strategic and critical metals imported from outside of Europe. &#xd;<br />It is this European strategic and critical metals dependency -notably out of China- that Neometal will contribute to solve because it aims to value European strategic and critical metals.","acronym":"","interests":"Economic and Financial Affairs","euInitiatives":"European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials","lastUp":"2017-02-01T19:43:59.876+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
