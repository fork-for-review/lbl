EPA works in partnership both to represent and give to parents a powerful voice in the development of policies and decisions at European level concerning children and their parents. In the field of education, EPA aims to promote the active participation of parents and the recognition of their central place as the primary responsible of the education of their children.&#xd;<br />EPA - the European Parents` Association - was founded in April 1985 in Milan Italy to establish an association of parents and families from all over Europe. The needs and interests of parents have been the focus of EPA activities since then.&#xd;<br />As one of the main concerns of parents is the child`s education in a holistic approach, permanent work was tributed to this field.  EPA`s position is that a partnership of parents and teachers will give the optimum conditions for the child`s education.&#xd;<br />The statutes was last adjusted in 2014. While the legal seat is in Belgium, during the years the office moved to the Netherlands, Spain and is now in Austria.&#xd;<br />EPA supports the participation and collaboration of parents in many educational respects by:&#xd;<br />•    Gathering and disseminating information by means of EPA publications including, newsletters, seminar reports, EPA website, discussion forums. •    Highlighting innovation in educational partnership and spreading information about interesting and innovative educational practices.&#xd;<br />•    Promoting parents’ ongoing support and training.&#xd;<br />•    Supporting research in all fields relating to the participation of he parents in the educational environment.&#xd;<br />Collaboration with various partners in the broad field of education.","acronym":"EPA","interests":"Communication, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Youth","euInitiatives":"All initiatives and policies in relation to children and their parents with special focus on&#xd;<br />- education (ECEC, ESL, LLL, VET, etc.)&#xd;<br />- social issues (equity, investing in children, child poverty, reconciliation of work and family life, Social Pillar etc.)&#xd;<br />- rights, especially rights of the child and parents&#xd;<br />- digital agenda&#xd;<br />- active citizenship","lastUp":"2018-05-01T01:46:50.926+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
