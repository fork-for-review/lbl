In each of its member associations, IMA-Europe counts the main EU producers of industrial minerals. &#xd;<br />Mission&#xd;<br />IMA-Europe’s primary mission is to promote the interests of the EU industrial minerals industry on all non-commercial issues. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />One voice for the industrial minerals sectors&#xd;<br />In response to the EU’s and national authorities’ expectations, IMA-Europe helps the industrial minerals industry to speak with one voice on sound scientific and technical dossiers.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Focus of activities&#xd;<br />The IMA-Europe umbrella covers horizontal issues which concern its member organisations. At EU level, IMA-Europe encourages a policy and regulatory framework that supports the competitiveness of the European industrial minerals industry. Its activities are thus focussed on the sustainable development of our industry and its main activities lie in the areas of health and safety (for workers and consumers), environmental protection &amp; biodiversity, communication and public relations  and the large flow of end-use product legislation (e.g. food and feed additives, food contact, cosmetics, etc.). &#xd;<br />The member associations’ autonomous structures are particularly adequate for dealing with product-specific issues (legislation, specifications, standardisation, etc.).&#xd;<br />A valued partner  &#xd;<br />IMA-Europe has grown steadily since its foundation in 1993 and is recognised as the representative body of the European industrial minerals sector. In this regard, the European Commission and national authorities regularly call upon IMA-Europe’s expertise to participate in expert panels such as: DG Enterprise’s Raw Materials Supply Group and SWPEI , etc. IMA-Europe is actively involved in the promotion of the extractive sector through the Non Energy Extractive Industry Panel (NEEIP) and is an active member of a number of BusinessEurope  Working Groups. &#xd;<br />IMA-Europe has liaisons with several standardisation committees of the ISO  and the CEN . &#xd;<br />A social partner and member of the Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee of the Extractive Industry (SSCDEI), IMA-Europe initiated the negotiation of the first multi-sectoral social dialogue agreement ever signed in the EU, with 14 industry sectors as signatories (April 2006) – (www.nepsi.eu).&#xd;<br />An active partner of the REACH Alliance, IMA-Europe has documented and gained an exemption from registration for natural industrial minerals not chemically modified. Coordinating the registration of the minerals concerned (i.e. chemically modified – e.g. soda-ash flux calcined diatomite- or chemically prepared – e.g. boric acid, precipitated calcium carbonate) and providing adequate assistance to member companies to be compliant with the various REACH obligations, IMA-Europe developed a REACH Hub (http://www.ima-reach-hub.eu/) and manages five REACH consortia covering a total of 17 mineral substances","acronym":"IMA-Europe","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Consumer Affairs, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, Food Safety, Internal Market, Public Health, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"Air Policy, Biocides, Climate Change and ETS, Health &amp; Safety, Industrial Policy, Innovation, Life Cycle Assessment, Metrology, No Net Loss, Physical Agents, Raw materials, REACH - CLP - SDS, Reporting of minerals resources &amp; reserves, Resource Efficiency, Seveso, Statistical and economic nomenclatures, Taxation of energy products, Waste","lastUp":"2018-02-15T10:45:44.885+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
