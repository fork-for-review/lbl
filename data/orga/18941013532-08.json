Alliance (EPHA) is an international non-profit association registered in Belgium.  Our membership is composed of not-for-profit organizations working on all aspects of public health.  EPHA`s mission is to promote and protect the health of all people living in Europe and to advocate for greater citizen participation in health-related policy making at the European level.  We disseminate information to our members on health-related EU policy and legislative initiatives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPHA is committed to transparency about EU interest representation.  EPHA believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide EU lobbying transparency.  When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency.  A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organizations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation.  Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European Institutions, a list of those who, on behalf of EPHA, carry out such activities.&#xd;<br />Our registration in based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU. Find the guidelines on http://wwwact4europe.ort/register or http://www.alter-eu.org.","acronym":"EPHA","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Climate Action, Consumer Affairs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Food Safety, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Information Society, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and Technology, Sport, Trade, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Under the EU Treaty, the EU can take action on health. It must aim to improve public health, prevent human illness and diseases, and identify sources of danger to human health, while fully respecting the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and health care.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In practice though, several EU policies impact on health and health systems (be it on professional mobility, agriculture and food, research etc...)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPHA aims to provide information on the EU institutions and their funding mechanisms in this section.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPHA takes part in the EU Health Policy Forum, the EU Alcohol Policy Forum and the EU Diet Platform.","lastUp":"2018-04-19T11:55:06.104+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
