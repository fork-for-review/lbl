Since then, Media Intelligence Partners has earned a reputation as one of Londonâ€™s most respected political consultancy and public relations firms. Based in Westminster, we call upon decades of experience and a deep network of contacts in politics and the media. We work with an international range of think tanks, companies, campaign groups, political figures and high net-worth individuals to help them achieve their goals. Media Intelligence Partners thrives on challenging briefs, emotive policy areas and campaigns which have the odds stacked against them. Our staff have spent decades working in national journalism and international politics. From the White House to Downing Street, Brussels to Fleet Street, our experience and our contacts make us invaluable to our clients. As well as the work Media Intelligence Partners does in the campaigning and corporate spheres, we provide media and presentation training courses tailored to the precise needs of business and political clients.","acronym":"MIP","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Audiovisual and Media, Budget, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"MIP carries out a number of activities including campaigning and advocacy, crisis management, political engagement and PR.","lastUp":"2018-04-03T12:27:25.413+02:00","customers":"Lynn's Country Foods Ltd","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":"100000-499999"}
