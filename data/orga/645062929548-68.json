Research and education have always been the University’s raison d’être; societal impact and talent development, although an inherent part of research and teaching, have recently been made a more explicit aspect of the University’s activities. If it is to fulfil its task here, the University needs to perform on regional, national and international levels. Although this presents opportunities, the competition is fierce, especially in the national and international fields. Furthermore, if we are to consolidate or preferably improve our position in the global academic world, we will need to perform and become even better in the four areas of research, education, societal impact and talent development. Our strategic objectives are therefore geared towards improvement in these areas. This is combined with global expansion in the shape of (inter)national branch campuses that should consolidate our education and research.","acronym":"UG","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Sport, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Research programs like Horizon 2020 and its successor FP9. &#xd;<br />Erasmus+&#xd;<br />Structural Funds&#xd;<br />Cohesion Funds","lastUp":"2018-01-12T16:13:58.207+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"400000-499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
