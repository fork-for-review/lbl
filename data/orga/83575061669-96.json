Its aim is to provide a regulatory environment that encourages innovation and supports a strong and competitive cosmetics industry in Europe. Files followed by Cosmetics Europe relate in particular to the implementation of the Cosmetic Products regulation, regulatory developments on cosmetics ingredients, consumer safety, consumer information, environmental and chemical issues. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2015 and 2016 we submitted responses to the public consultation on geo-blocking and on-line platforms – we followed many files under the digital single market initiative; circular economy; REFIT of chemicals legislation (excluding REACH). Cosmetics Europe regularly submits on behalf of its members observations to the EU institutions on legislative proposals relevant for its members’ activities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />For the purpose of its science research, Cosmetics Europe is following very closely the EU Research and Innovation program Horizon 2020 - the biggest EU research program ever with nearly €80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020). More particularly, Cosmetics Europe collaborated with the Commission in the SEURAT-1 (Safety Evaluation Ultimately Replacing Animal Testing) research initiative with a budget of 50 million euros to try to fill current gaps in scientific knowledge and accelerate the development of non-animal test methods. SEURAT-1 focused on the complex area of repeated dose toxicity. This project ended in 2015. Cosmetics Europe has also embarked on a Long Range Science Strategy (2016-2020). The objective of the Long Range Science Strategy (LRSS) collaboration is to finance, steer and promote the successful development of AAT-based test methods and approaches for safety assessment and to facilitate their regulatory acceptance.  Additionally, Cosmetics Europe is partnering with the European Commission in the wider framework of the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) - an unprecedented voluntary collaboration between the European Commission, European trade associations, and companies from seven industry sectors. The partners are committed to pooling knowledge and resources to accelerate the development, validation and acceptance of alternative approaches to further the replacement, reduction and refinement (3Rs) of animal use in regulatory testing.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Finally, Cosmetics Europe works closely with the EU institutions on the elaboration and the adoption of technical standards such as ISO / CEN and on the promotion of international convergence of worldwide cosmetics regulations, in particular through its participation in ICCR (International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation).  Cosmetics Europe also keeps a close relationship with the Commission on external trade related issues in connection with the activities of its members.","lastUp":"2017-04-14T14:08:41.708+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"400000-499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
