We have also secured landmark agreements to outlaw the barren battery cage for egg-laying hens, narrow veal crates and sow stalls across Europe&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Compassion in World Farming’s Food Business Team is working with some of the world’s biggest food companies - retailers, producers and manufacturers. The companies we work with are a key part of the drive towards a more ethical and sustainable food supply. Our Good Farm Animal Welfare awards are already benefitting millions of animals each year.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Consumer Affairs, Development, Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, Public Health, Research and Technology, Trade","euInitiatives":"Antimicrobial resistance&#xd;<br />EU sustainable food and farming policy&#xd;<br />Sustainable Development Goals&#xd;<br />COP23&#xd;<br />CAP&#xd;<br />Enforcement of acquis on animal welfare&#xd;<br />Bilateral and multilateral trade agreements&#xd;<br />Current legislative proposals and existing laws on animal welfare&#xd;<br />Welfare of farmed rabbits&#xd;<br />Public procurement","lastUp":"2018-02-22T14:38:30.504+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
