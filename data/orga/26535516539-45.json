We believe that the biggest cause of cruelty on the planet deserves a focused, specialised approach – so we only work on farm animal welfare.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our political lobbying and campaigning has resulted in the EU recognising animals as sentient beings, capable of feeling pain and suffering. We have also secured landmark agreements to outlaw the barren battery cage for egg-laying hens, narrow veal crates and sow stalls across Europe&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Compassion in World Farming’s Food Business Team is working with some of the world’s biggest food companies - retailers, producers and manufacturers. The companies we work with are a key part of the drive towards a more ethical and sustainable food supply. Our Good Farm Animal Welfare awards are already benefitting millions of animals each year.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Consumer Affairs, Development, Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, Public Health, Trade","euInitiatives":"Antimicrobial resistance&#xd;<br />EU sustainable food and farming policy&#xd;<br />Sustainable Development Goals&#xd;<br />COP23&#xd;<br />CAP&#xd;<br />Enforcement of acquis on animal welfare&#xd;<br />Bilateral and multilateral trade agreements&#xd;<br />Current legislative proposals and existing laws on animal welfare&#xd;<br />Welfare of farmed rabbits&#xd;<br />Public procurement","lastUp":"2017-02-22T13:30:07.366+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
