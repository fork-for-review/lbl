This is still the primary goal today. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />On the 22nd June 1998 the Association's statute was reconstructed so as to form The Federation for Hunting &amp; Conservation - Malta (Federazzjoni Kaċċaturi Nassaba Konservazzjonisti – FKNK) which incorporates an average of 23 Associations from as many districts and specific committees.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />On the 11th September 1987, the Federation joined FACE (The Federation of Associations for Hunting &amp; Conservation in the EU).  On the 26th May 1989, the Federation was also accepted as a member of CIC (The International Council for Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation) and on the 6th July, 1995, the Maltese Federation was one of the founder members of AECT (The Association of Traditional Hunting in Europe).  In the year 2000 the FKNK was also one of the founder members of the Communications Group within FACE, InterFACE.  In 2008 the FKNK formed part of FACE Members within the Mediterranean basin to set up FACE MED and also became a member of ELO (European Landowners’ Organisation).  In 2010 the FKNK enrolled as an NGO with the Malta Commissioner of Voluntary Organisations and also joined OMPO (Migratory Birds of the Western Palearctic).  In 2016 the FKNK became FITASC Malta representative.
