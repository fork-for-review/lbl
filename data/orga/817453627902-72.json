These include, notably, metabolic syndrome, diabetes type II and obesity. To do this, Sugarwise identifies, engages with and promotes methods of sugar reduction that are deemed to be effective in the near and long term, paying special attention to efficacy in disadvantaged communities.","acronym":"","interests":"Education, Public Health, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"Sugarwise is responding to the European Commission's evaluation of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 (Nutrition and Health Claims â€“ NHC Regulation). Our position is that the special status of sugar and sugar related diseases warrants an exception whereby sugar claims will be permitted even where e.g. saturated fat content is high. This would recognise that the scientific consensus on the harm done by sugar is more robust than fat or salt, and the urgency of sugar reduction is widely acknowledged to be more pressing.","lastUp":"2018-01-25T17:04:29.865+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
