We also work with other pan-European prevention initiatives.  For instance we are a collaborating partner in the current project to adapt the Universal Prevention Curriculum (for practitioners involved in the delivery of prevention interventions).  See http://upc-adapt.eu/partners/ .&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe EUSPR plays an active role in international networks, and has close ties with other prevention societies, including the USA Society for Prevention Research (SPR) - see http://www.preventionresearch.org/ .

The work of the Society supports the Strategy's key objectives and the actions outline in the Drugs Action Plan designed to fulfil these objectives.  In particular the Society's activities support the Strategy's objectives relating to i) coordination of \"discourse and analysis of developments and challenges in the field of drugs at EU and international level\"; 2) \"strengthen[ing] dialogue and cooperation between the EU and third countries, international organisations and fora on drug issues; and 3) promotion of research on the effectiveness of interventions to create a basis for policies, and the dissemination of results.","lastUp":"2018-04-15T16:40:26.638+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
