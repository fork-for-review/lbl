In the spirit of multi-stakeholder collaboration, OGP is overseen by a Steering Committee including representatives of governments and civil society organizations.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />To become a member of OGP, participating countries and localities must endorse a high-level Open Government Declaration, deliver a country action plan developed with public consultation, and commit to independent reporting on their progress going forward.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Open Government Partnership formally launched on September 20, 2011, when the 8 founding governments (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, the Philippines, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States) endorsed the Open Government Declaration, and announced their country action plans. Since 2011, OGP has welcomed the commitment of 88 additional national and local governments to join the Partnership.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In total, 76 OGP participating countries and 20 subnational governments have made over 2,500 commitments to make their governments more open and accountable.","acronym":"OGP","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Audiovisual and Media, Budget, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Our main interaction with the EU institution is to share information regarding OGP member countries and EU members and their progress in OGP.
