The development of the GSEF began following the Seoul Declaration, which was adopted by eight local governments and nine social economy organizations during GSEF 2013, held in Seoul on November 5 – 7, 2013 on the theme “New Discovery of Collaboration” (www.gsef2013.org). The Seoul Declaration was the outcome of the determination of local governments and social organizations who recognized the need for global solidarity in the area of social economy. Following this first successful event, GSEF2014 (www.gsef2014.org) was held simultaneously with the foundation general assembly of GSEF. It included the participation of 18 local governments and 43 international SSE organizations pursuing the expansion of knowledge-sharing and cooperative relationships among global social economy actors. Under the slogan ‘solidarity for change,’ the GSEF2014 inaugural meeting led to the permanent creation of an international association of SSE based on the adoption of the GSEF Charter. The third edition of GSEF, GSEF2016 (www.gsef2016.org) took place outside Korea for the first time in Montreal with the theme ‘local governments and social economy stakeholders – allies for the intelligent and sustainable development of cities.’ &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The C.I.T.I.E.S (international center for innovation and knowledge transfer on the social and solidarity economy) forum was officially launched at GSEF2016. The ‘Montreal Declaration’ was also adopted to affirm the commitment of participants to the promotion of the social economy. The fourth edition of the forum, GSEF 2018, will take place in the city of Bilbao. We hope that the GSEF will be now be open to become a more dynamic and active solidarity body based on the consent of the participating entities. Vision GSEF aims for the harmonious progress of the market economy, public economy, social economy, and ecology in general. This progress will make the best use of an individual’s ability and solve social problems through solidarity among social economy subjects. Therefore, GSEF will serve as a global solidarity network to achieve these goals. Mission Through collaboration between social economy organizations and local governments, GSEF pursues creation of quality jobs, fair growth, progress of grassroots democracy, and sustainable development. Values such as human dignity and sustainable ecology are to be the underlying principles for every GSEF activity. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The GSEF contributes to enhancing the quality and quantity of shared resources and promotes the fair approach and the use of such resources. The key to reclaiming the commons is trust and cooperation, which are the fundamentals for SSE. Ecosystem, culture, knowledge, and historical resources of all local communities are all important objectives of GSEF activities.","acronym":"GSEF","interests":"Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Employment and Social Affairs, Enterprise, Regional Policy, Youth","euInitiatives":"Social Business Initiative (COM(2011) 682 final)&#xd;<br />Social innovation policy making&#xd;<br />Small Business Act&#xd;<br />the flagship initiative, The Innovation Union&#xd;<br />the Communication, 'Business in the social economy","lastUp":"2018-03-14T02:23:09.518+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"600000-699999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
