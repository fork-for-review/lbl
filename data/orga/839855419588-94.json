We work with victims, civil society groups, national and international organizations to ensure redress for victims and to help prevent atrocities from happening again. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ICTJ brings more than 15 years of experience in over 40 countries to try to answer the difficult questions about what can be done in these terrible circumstances to ensure the dignity of victims is recognized and respected, and measures are taken to prevent the recurrence of violations.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />While many groups working on human rights focus on exposing and denouncing violations and atrocities, our focus is on what often proves even more challenging - trying to put the pieces of a broken society back together again on foundations of justice and the rule of law. This requires staying in the struggle for the long haul and being an active part of the solution. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our goals are concrete and tangible:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Fighting impunity and seeking accountability for serious violations of human rights&#xd;<br />Establishing accountable institutions and restoring confidence in them&#xd;<br />Increasing access to justice for the most vulnerable in society in the aftermath of violations&#xd;<br />Ensuring that women play an effective role in the pursuit of a just society&#xd;<br />Restoring respect for the rule of law&#xd;<br />Facilitating peace processes and fostering durable resolutions of conflicts&#xd;<br />Establishing a basis to address the underlying causes of conflict and marginalization&#xd;<br />Making sure the voices of young people are heard on issues that directly affect them&#xd;<br />Advancing the cause of reconciliation&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We work in countries around the world, with offices in New York City, Brussels and The Hague . We have local teams working with partners in Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Lebanon, Nepal, Tunisia, and Uganda, and maintain offices in The Hague and Brussels. Our experts also assist transitional justice efforts in many other countries where we don’t have offices, including Syria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri Lanka, South Africa, South Sudan, Turkey, and Ukraine.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ICTJ has been called on to help in some of the most challenging contexts:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In Colombia, our advice was at the heart of the peace negotiations, helping shape critical aspects of the agreement that has brought an end to the longest running conflict in the Western Hemisphere.&#xd;<br />In northern Uganda, ICTJ’s work on reparations gives hope for a life of dignity to children born of conflict-related sexual violence which were employed as instruments of terror during the war between the government and LRA.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In Tunisia, our experts are advising those involved in the transitional justice process, offering a way to address the legacy of decades dictatorship and of systemic corruption which robbed the country and its citizens of economic and political opportunities. ICTJ’s work is ensuring the participation of women in the transitional justice processes, from sharing their experiences as victims to holding decision-making positions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In Syria we are emphasizing the need to focus on the enormous numbers of displaced people as the first step to developing a coherent transitional justice approach. Without dignified return and meaningful restitution the all for justice will ring hollow for more than half of the population. We are also working with Syrian civil society leaders to effectively use documentation of human rights violations to reduce impunity.","acronym":"ICTJ Brussels","interests":"Development, Enlargement, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Home Affairs, Humanitarian Aid, Justice and Fundamental Rights","euInitiatives":"EU external policies in the field of Human Rights, conflict prevention and peace building; EU and MS policies on transitional justice, human rights, peace building and development; implementation of EU external aid programs, multi annual strategies and annual action plans related to following fields: human rights, peace building and conflict prevention, support to CSO, development;  policy initiatives in the field of development, rule of law, governance .","lastUp":"2017-11-09T17:16:49.507+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
