We challenge the current model of economic and corporate globalization, and promote solutions that will help to create environmentally sustainable and socially just societies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We promote environmentally sustainable societies on the local, national, regional and global levels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We seek to increase public participation and democratic decision-making. Greater democracy is both an end in itself and is vital to the protection of the environment and the sound management of natural resources.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We work towards environmental, social, economic and political justice and equal access to resources and opportunities on the local, national, regional and international levels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Friends of the Earth Europe is committed to transparency about EU interest representation. Friends of the Earth Europe believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide full EU lobbying transparency. When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of Friends of the Earth Europe, carry out such activities.","acronym":"FoEE","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Climate Action, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Food Safety, General and Institutional Affairs, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Trade&#xd;<br />-Negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)&#xd;<br />-European Parliament resolution of 8 July 2015 containing the European Parliamentâ€™s recommendations to the European Commission on the negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) (2014/2228(INI))&#xd;<br />- Negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Financial regulation&#xd;<br />- The shareholder Rights Directive; (COM/2014/0213 final - 2014/0121 (COD))&#xd;<br />- Revision of the Directive on Institutions for - Occupational Retirement Provision (IORPs) (COM/2014/0167 final - 2014/0091 (COD))&#xd;<br />- Capital Markets Union (COM(2015) 468 final)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Shale gas&#xd;<br />- EC Recommendation on use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing (fracking) (2014/70/EU)&#xd;<br />- EP ITRE opinion on Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) (PE 546.749v03-00)&#xd;<br />- Europe-Latin America Parliamentary Assembly report on \"opportunity and challenges of shale gas in Europe and Latin America\" (AP101.708v02-00)&#xd;<br />- EP report on European Energy Security Strategy (2014/2153(INI))&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />GMOs:&#xd;<br />- Member States restrictions on GMO cultivation (Directive (EU) 2015/412)&#xd;<br />- Reviewing the decision- making process on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) (COM(2015) 176)&#xd;<br />- reviewing directive 2001/18 on environmental risk assessment&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Biodiversity:&#xd;<br />- EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020&#xd;<br />- Birds Directive (Council Directive 2009/147/EC) &#xd;<br />- Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC)&#xd;<br />- Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC) &#xd;<br />- Future EU initiative on No Net Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Biofuels: &#xd;<br />- Use of biofuels in transport (Directive (EU) 2015/1513) &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Common Agricultural Policy:&#xd;<br />- Direct payments (Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013)&#xd;<br />- Rural development (Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013)&#xd;<br />- Financing and monitoring of the common agricultural policy (Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013) &#xd;<br />- Tackling unfair trading practices in the business-to-business food supply chain (COM(2014) 472 final)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Climate justice and energy&#xd;<br />- Energy efficiency directive (procedure 2011/0172(COD))&#xd;<br />- EU 2030 climate and energy targets &#xd;<br />Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 (procedure 2011/2095(INI))&#xd;<br />- Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RES Directive 2009/28/EC)&#xd;<br />- State Aid guidelines&#xd;<br />- Energy security package&#xd;<br />- Market Design Initiative and Directive&#xd;<br />- Just transition&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Circular Economy:&#xd;<br />- Closing the loop - An EU action plan for the Circular Economy (COM(2015) 614 )&#xd;<br />- Amendment of Waste Directive (COM(2015) 595 final 2015/0275(COD))&#xd;<br />- Amendment of packaging and packaging waste Directive (COM(2015) 596 final 2015/0276(COD))&#xd;<br />- Amendment of the landfill of waste Directive (COM(2015) 594 final 2015/0274(COD))&#xd;<br />- European Parliament resolution on resource efficiency (2014/2208(INI))&#xd;<br />- Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (COM(2011) 571) / procedure 2011/1068(INI))&#xd;<br />- Raw material Initiative (COM(2008)699) in November 2008, under Horizon 2020&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda)&#xd;<br />-COM(2016) 739 final  - Next steps for a sustainable European future -  European action for sustainability&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Better regulation &amp; transparency&#xd;<br />- Better regulation package of the European Commission (u.a.
