As UK policy and law making is increasingly intrinsically linked to EU-based decisions, EPPA UK’s Westminster and Brussels’ institutional and policy knowledge and experience is key to helping our clients develop their public affairs programmes by steering their dialogue with the appropriate audiences at the appropriate times either side of the Channel. This inter-institutional expertise also allows us to manage pan-European client programmes, particularly in the transport, environment and media sectors, using a network of public affairs practitioners across the EU.","acronym":"","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Customs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Vehicle design, transport and environmental policies: Transport White Paper, REACH, proposal to simplify the transfer of motor vehicles registered in another Member State within the Single Market COM(2012) 164 final, the Urban Mobility Package, Intelligent Transport Systems policy, Culture policy, Customs and tariffs, vehicle tax policy","lastUp":"2017-02-20T19:10:34.471+01:00","customers":"Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":"0-99999"}
