We advocate a model of cooperation that looks for complex, structural and sustainable solutions to problems and inequalities that the current system provokes and that fights for breaking performances that generate more poverty or temporary solutions. We are committed to the dissemination of truthful information, knowledge and experiences on the issues and causes in which we work. Focus on networking, building alliances and participation in European spaces.&#xd;<br />In Alianza por la Solidaridad, we are convinced that this way of managing the complexity of development is the key to social transformation in an efficient and lasting way: in order to be unstoppable.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our values and beliefs&#xd;<br />•\tWe believe in the power of individuals and groups to change the world. When people organize, pool their capabilities and direct their efforts to transform their societies, correcting the deeply rooted inequalities in a sustainable way, they empower and produce changes.&#xd;<br />•\tWe believe that all people on the planet have to be citizens. We stand with ambition that all human beings have equal value and deserve to enjoy all the universal rights that go beyond geographical boundaries and therefore, must have legal and social capacity in order to demand these rights to the States and the international community.&#xd;<br />•\tWe believe it is our duty to collaborate with future generations in order to create opportunities to build a new model of life based on justice and equality, as well as respect for the planet and its natural and cultural diversity and richness.&#xd;<br />•\tWe believe that solidarity is the main moral and political link in which you can create a global society of citizens who respect diversity within a common framework of Human Rights.&#xd;<br />•\tWe believe that the best role social organizations can play is being catalysts and mediators of partnerships among actors who mobilize resources, knowledge and skills, in order to facilitate the empowerment of citizens and their organizations.&#xd;<br />•\tWe believe that learning and knowledge are an essential part of social organizations and their role in the service of social change and the empowerment of people is one of our main functions.&#xd;<br />•\tWe believe that transparency and accountability must structure our organization as much about resources and funds which we manage as about the impact and changes that we generate in our work.","acronym":"ALIANZA","interests":"Budget, Climate Action, Development, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Humanitarian Aid, Taxation","euInitiatives":"Cotonou Revision, EU-CELAC relations and EU-CELAC CSO Fórum, MFF and Eu delegation roadmaps, European Consensus on Development, Business and Human Rights Treaty and Global Compaq, Maddad Trust Fund, Emergency Trust Fund for Sahel and Sahel Strategy, Colombia Peace Process  and its Trust Fund, ECHO annual Plans and HIPS (Colombia, Palestine, Siria crisis.
