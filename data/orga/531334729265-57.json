In addition, CICAP is also involved in the analysis of the reasons and dynamics facilitating the dissemination of fake news and how to intervene fruitfully against them, organizing lectures, seminars and conferences such as “CICAP-Fest 2017”, a three-day scientific festival composed of tens of conferences, seminars, lectures, laboratories both for the general public and for specific targets (journalists, students, etc.) held in different venues in the city of Cesena. CICAP is also actively involved in the discussion on how the institutions could act to prevent this problem.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CICAP activities are shared with the broad public through conferences and public lectures, radio and television appearances, social networks, through the publication of a quarterly magazine, Query, books and articles, and through the conservation of a library and the collection of an archive of articles, made available to the public. Additional material, both on CICAP own investigations as well as foreign skeptical and scientific material translated into Italian, is published on Query Online (www.queryonline.it, the online version of the printed magazine.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Social Impact:&#xd;<br />Followers on Facebook: 76.000&#xd;<br />Followers on Twitter: 109.000&#xd;<br />Website Visitors: 90.000/month (including www.cicap.org and www.queryonline.it)&#xd;<br />Members: 1546&#xd;<br />Active Members: more than 100&#xd;<br />Active Local/Regional Groups: 14&#xd;<br />Public Events (Conferences, Seminars, etc.): around 200/year&#xd;<br />Published Articles (paper and online magazine): around 300/year","acronym":"CICAP","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Climate Action, Communication, Culture, Education, Public Health, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"CICAP is an influential voice in the public debate on fake news and pseudoscience and is&#xd;<br />regularly consulted on these topics by institutions and mass media alike. For instance, it is&#xd;<br />a member of a Quango on fake news promoted by the Parliament, and it collaborates with&#xd;<br />the Italian Ministry of Industry, University and Research (MIUR) on education and&#xd;<br />prevention of fake news.&#xd;<br />The main area where CICAP can support the EU policy is therefore the EU campaign&#xd;<br />against fake news (euvsdisinfo.eu). More specifically, as detailed below, CICAP also&#xd;<br />supports the policies of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control&#xd;<br />(https://ecdc.europa.eu/), of the European Climate Action Programme&#xd;<br />(https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/eccp_en), of the European Union Evidence Based&#xd;<br />Medicine Unity (http://ebm-unity.pc.unicatt.it/ebm/index.html), and Resolution 1580 of the&#xd;<br />Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe concerning the dangers of creationism in&#xd;<br />education (http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-&#xd;<br />ViewHTML.asp?FileID=11751&amp;amp;lang=en)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CICAP acts as a mediator between institutions and citizens, contributing to explain to the&#xd;<br />broad public the national and EU policies (for example: in the field of health, CICAP has&#xd;<br />organized meetings and conferences on the benefits of vaccination as well as campaigns&#xd;<br />against non evidence based treatments), spreading the recommendations of WHO and&#xd;<br />EU; on environmental issues, explaining the phenomenon of global warming and the&#xd;<br />danger of overlooking its effects and therefore boosting support for the Kyoto protocol.","lastUp":"2017-12-15T13:13:54.682+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
